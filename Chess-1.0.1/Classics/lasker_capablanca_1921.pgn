{Notes by J. R. Capablanca.} 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.O-O
d6 5.d4 Bd7 6.Nc3 Be7 7.Re1 exd4 8.Nxd4 O-O 9.Bf1 Re8 10.f3
Bf8 11.Bg5 h6 12.Bh4 g6 13.Nd5 Bg7 {I cannot very highly
recommend the system of defense adopted by me in this
variation.} 14.Nb5 {The combinations beginning with this move
are all wrong. White's proper move was simply to hold the
position by playing c3. After the text move, Black should get
the better game.} g5 15.Ndxc7 {If 15.Bf2, Nxd5 would give
Black the better game. The combination indulged in by White is
good only in appearence.} gxh4 16.Nxa8 Qxa8 17.Nc7 Qd8 18.Nxe8
Nxe8 19.Rb1 Be6 20.c3 Bxa2 {A mistake. Black had here a won
game by playing Be5. The question of time at this point was
not properly appreciated by Black, who went in to recover a
Pawn, which was of no impotance whatever. Worse yet, the
capture of the Pawn only helped White.} 21.Ra1 Be6 22.Qd2 a6
{h3 was better. After the text move Black has an extremely
difficult game to play.} 23.Qf2 h5 {Qg5 would have given Black
better chances to win. After the text move there is nothing
better than a draw.} 24.f4 Bh6 25.Be2 Nf6 26.Qxh4 Nxe4
27.Qxd8+ Nxd8 28.Bxa6 d5 29.Be2 Bxf4 30.Bxh5 Bc7 31.Rad1
{Having had twenty-four hours to consider the position, we
both came to the conclusion that there was nothing in it but a
draw.} 1/2-1/2
