1. d4 { After trying 1.e4 and 1.Nf3, Ding gave 1.d4 a try! } 1... Nf6 2. Bf4 { The famous London System, a very interesting opening which is sometimes considered as a nightmare by many players! Ding said in a press conference that until now he has played with the white pieces as if he had the black pieces and that he has decided to change his approach. As a consequence, he chose the London system because last year he managed to win with it. Is Ding getting in a warrior state of mind? } 2... d5 3. e3 e6 4. Nf3 c5 { the most common way of playing with black } 5. c3 { a line which is reputated to be solid. } (5. Nbd2 { is another way to play } 5... Bd6 6. dxc5 { for instance. }) 5... Bd6 6. Bb5+!? { an interesting sideline. It has already been played by Carlsen against Ding himself in 2023. They drew the game but maybe it gave some ideas to Ding! } (6. Bg3 { is the main line. }) (6. Ne5) (6. Nbd2) 6... Nc6 7. Bxc6+ { white gives his bishop in order to weaken the black structure. In this kind of position, white has to play on dark squares and has to try to take advantage of the c5-square. } (7. Ne5 O-O!? 8. Bxc6 bxc6 9. Nxc6 Qc7 10. Bxd6 Qxd6 11. Ne5 Rb8 { Black has a good initiative for the pawn. }) 7... bxc6 8. Bxd6 Qxd6 9. Qa4 { a normal continuation to put pressure on the structure. } 9... O-O 10. Qa3 { White follows the right plan as said previously. If Ding manages to exchange the queens he could get a favorable endgame. } (10. Nbd2 { Is another way to play. GM Gata Kamsky is an expert in this position, he has already played this position dozens of times. }) (10. O-O { was played by Carlsen against Ding. It seems that Ding thought Qa3 is an improvement. } 10... cxd4 11. cxd4 c5 12. Rc1 c4) 10... Ne4 { the main line, Gukesh was still in a known field. } (10... Nd7 { is also possible even though it is a bit more passive. } 11. O-O Re8 12. c4 e5 13. cxd5 cxd5 14. Nc3 { seems a bit more pleasant for white. }) (10... a5!? { is very interesting as well. } 11. Qxc5 (11. O-O Ne4) 11... Qb8! 12. Nbd2 Ba6 $44) 11. Nfd2 { only 7 games were played in that position, with a pretty good score for white. } (11. Nbd2 { seems more logical but the difference is that after } 11... cxd4 { white can not take on e4 like in the other line. } 12. Qxd6 (12. Nxe4? Qxa3 13. bxa3 dxe4 14. Nxd4 Ba6 $17) 12... Nxd6 13. cxd4 Rb8 14. b3 Ba6) (11. O-O c4!? { is actually possible even if it does not look really attractive. It is justified by the fact the b2-pawn will become a weakness after the rook goes to b8. } 12. Qxd6 Nxd6 13. b3 f6 { Kamsky,G - Sevian,S 2023 (0-1) }) 11... e5! { the right reaction as now the e5-square is not controlled anymore. Gukesh is going to give a pawn for the initiative. We are still following the game between Aronian and Dominguez in 2022. } (11... cxd4 { is not good now } 12. Nxe4! Qxa3 13. Nxa3 dxe4 14. cxd4 $16 { White has a clear positional advantage. }) 12. Nxe4 dxe4 13. Qxc5 (13. Nd2 { would just be better for black. } 13... exd4 14. exd4 Rb8 15. O-O Qg6 $15) (13. dxe5 Qxe5 14. Nd2 Qg5 $36) 13... Qg6 { Black should keep the queen to put some pressure on the white position. Qg6 is a very natural move to attack the g2-pawn. } 14. Nd2 (14. O-O Bh3 $19) (14. g3 Ba6 $17 { gives black a strong initiative on the light squares. }) (14. Qxe5 Qxg2 $19) 14... Qxg2 15. O-O-O { we are now getting an opposite castle position. It could potentially transpose to dangerous positions for both sides but it seems that both players were still in their preparation. } 15... Qxf2 16. dxe5 { After that move, Gukesh enter his first real thought. We can assume he was finally out of preparation. The position is objectively fine according to computer, but it does not mean it is without any risk! } (16. Qxc6 Bh3 17. Rhg1 Bg2! 18. d5 Rac8 $13) (16. Rde1 { was played by Aronian in 2022 but after } 16... exd4 17. Nxe4 Qh4 18. exd4 (18. Qxd4 Bf5 19. Ng3 Qh3 $15) 18... Be6 19. Qxc6 Rfd8! $17 { is pretty good for black as both Bd5 and Rxd4 followed by Rc8 are threatening. }) 16... Rb8 { a logical continuation, activating the rook and attacking the b2-pawn } (16... Bg4!? { is another interesting try. } 17. Nxe4 Qf5 18. Ng3 Qe6 19. Rd4 Bh3 { with a very complex position. }) 17. Nc4 { if white manages to install the knight is d6, they could definitely be better. } (17. Qxc6? { would be too risky. } 17... Rd8 18. Nc4 (18. Rhf1 Qe2 $17) 18... Be6! { is already winning for black, white has too many issues. }) (17. Qxa7? { In general, we should not be too greedy and take the pawns that open the lines on your own castle. } 17... Bh3 { followed by Ra8 and white will be under big pressure. }) 17... Be6 (17... Qf3 { has been played in correspondence games } 18. Rhe1 Qf2 19. Rh1 { if Gukesh knew about Qf3 idea, would Ding go for this draw? I guess we will never know }) 18. Rd2 { Bxc4 followed by Qxb2 was a threat. } 18... Qf3 19. Re1 Bxc4 { Gukesh decides to immediately exchange the minor pieces although it was not forced. } (19... h6 { waiting a bit was also possible } 20. a4 { Threatening Nd6 now the a2-pawn is not hanging } (20. Nd6 { can be played but it is a bit risky after } 20... Bxa2 21. c4 a5!? 22. Rg1 Kh7 { with a very unclear position. }) 20... Bxc4 21. Qxc4 { with an equal position, both sides have chances. }) 20. Qxc4 Qf5 { After that move, Ding was out of preparation as he started to think for a long time. } (20... Rbd8 { was better } 21. Rd6 h5 22. a4 Rde8) 21. Qxc6 Qxe5 22. Qd5 Qe7 (22... Qxd5 23. Rxd5 f5 24. b4 { would be clearly in favor of white thanks to the c-passed pawn. }) 23. Qd6 (23. Red1!? { was really logical, to get the control of the d-file. } 23... h6 24. Qf5 $14 { white is putting some pressure thanks the control of the d-file. }) 23... Qg5 24. Qd5 Qe7 25. Qd6 { Ding is implicitely offering a draw. It is a pity as he has a very promising position once again. } (25. Red1!? { once again is a good try. }) 25... Qg5 26. Qd5 Qh4?! { a surprising choice that shows that Gukesh does not want to make short draws. He should probably not be too reckless. However, Ding has not yet shown the mindset of someone who wants to take advantage of Gukesh's inaccuracies.He declared in the press conference about that choice: " I thought I always have counterplay... It's not for playing for a win or anything. I just wanted to make a few more moves and see what happens." } 27. Red1 { white now has good control of the position and has a clear advantage. } 27... g6 28. Qe5 (28. c4!? { is another move to consider. White must use his passed pawn at some point to put pressure on black position. However, it can be a double-edged decision as the white king can find himself exposed. } 28... Rfc8 29. b3 { white is consolidating without a problem. }) 28... Rbe8 29. Qg3!? { Many other queen moves are possible but this is probably the best practical choice. } (29. Qa5 Qh3 30. Qxa7 { which leads to a very sharp line. } 30... Ra8 31. Qd4 Rxa2 32. Kb1 Ra6 33. c4 Qc8 34. Qxe4 Ra8 $40 { is very unclear, but from a human view it looks way more dangerous for white. }) 29... Qh5 { I could mark this move as an inaccuracy as there is a big difference in the evaluation between 29...Qxg3 and 29...Qh5 but to be honest the best move was not so easy to play. } (29... Qxg3 { was better according to computer but Gukesh was probably scared of the following endgame } 30. hxg3 Re5 31. b4 Rg5 32. c4!? (32. Rg1 h5 $13) 32... Rxg3 33. c5 Rxe3 34. c6 Rc3+ 35. Rc2 Rxc2+ 36. Kxc2 $13 { Both sides will push their pawn but black has to be much more careful as the white pawn is more advanced. For instance } 36... Kg7 37. a4 h5 38. b5 h4 39. a5 Rc8! { only move! } 40. Kb3 h3 41. Rc1 h2 42. Rh1 { only move! } 42... f5 43. Rxh2 f4 { and there is no need to continue the analysis, but on precise play from both players, this is draw. }) 30. Qf4 Qa5 (30... a5!? { is the idea given by computer. Black will actually try to attack the white castle. } 31. a4! { the best reaction, white keeps an advantage. } 31... Qf3 $13) 31. a3 Qb5 32. Rd4 { a logical move, to centralize and attack the e4-pawn } 32... Qe2 33. R1d2 Qf3 34. Kc2? { Once again, Ding does not try to take advantage of his better position and allows Gukesh to simplify the game. } (34. Qg5! { Was giving a great advantage for white. White should not be scared to keep the queens as black cannot really create any attack here. White will try to put the king in a safer place (a2 for example), and then start to push the c-pawn. } 34... Qh1+ 35. Kc2 Rb8 36. Rb4 $16) 34... Qxf4 35. exf4 f5 { now black has managed to exchange the queens and to get his passed pawn as well - Gukesh is not in danger anymore. } 36. h4 e3 { many moves are possible, but this one could be the risker one as the pawn could become weak. } (36... Kg7!? { Gukesh could have tried to bring the king on the kingside. The position can actually become dangerous for white. } 37. c4 (37. h5 g5! $17) (37. Rd7+ { the move that Gukesh feared } 37... Rf7 (37... Kh6 { but he missed this idea } 38. Rxa7 e3 { and this is winning for black } (38... Kh5 { Gukesh only calculated this line } 39. Rg2 h6 40. Rh7)) 38. Rxf7+ Kxf7 39. Rd7+ Re7 40. Rxe7+ Kxe7 41. c4) 37... Kh6 38. Kd1 Kh5 39. Ke2 Kxh4 40. Ke3 g5 41. Rg2! Rd8 42. Rxd8 Rxd8 43. Rxg5 Rd3+ 44. Ke2 Rb3 45. Rxf5 Kg4 46. Rf8 h5 $13 { looks risky for white. }) 37. Re2 Re7 38. Kd3 Rfe8 39. h5 { the easiest way to simplify. } (39. c4 Kg7) 39... gxh5 40. Rd5 h4 41. Rxf5 Rd7+ 42. Kc2 Kg7 43. Rg2+ { stopping the king from going further. } 43... Kh8 (43... Kh6 44. Rf6+ Kh5 45. Rg5#) 44. Re2 Kg7 45. Rg2+ Kh8 46. Re2 { an interesting game with great preparation by both players. They both could have tried a bit harder to get chances at some point. I think, that in this game we can see the different approaches between them. Ding may be a bit too careful about his decisions and Gukesh a bit too reckless. } 1/2-1/2
