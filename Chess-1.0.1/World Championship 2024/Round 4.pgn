1. Nf3 { Ding decides to return to his first love after trying 1.e4 in game 2. In his prime, Ding was an expert in English and Reti positions. } 1... d5 2. e3!? { It could already be considered as a surprise. But as we have seen, since the beginning of the match (apart from game 1), both players tend to avoid very theoretical and sharp openings. I am sure that we will see other moves like this in the next games. This move is very flexible, White can choose to continue with either c4, b3, or d4. } 2... Nf6 3. b3 { That move probably came as a surprise for Gukesh as he thought for more than 5 minutes about his reply. } 3... Bf5 { a logical continuation, but many others are possible here. } (3... c5) (3... g6) (3... e6) (3... Bg4) 4. Be2 h6 (4... e6 { is also possible to avoid the idea of the game but would allow White to grab the bishop after } 5. Nh4 Bg6 6. Bb2 $13) 5. Ba3!? { An uncommon move and probably the idea Ding came to the game with. This is not a novelty as it already had been played by So in 2021. The idea is to kind of force the trade of dark square bishop and lead to less known positions than 5.Bb2. } 5... Nbd7 (5... g6?! { but it would only benefit white after } 6. c4 c6 7. O-O Bg7 8. d4 { & the a3-bishop is shinning. }) 6. O-O e6 7. Bxf8 Nxf8 8. c4 N8d7 { This is the moment where Ding went for a deep think for the 1st time. That came as a surprise as black's last move is very natural and has been played in the game So-Giri in 2021. } 9. Nc3 (9. cxd5 exd5 10. b4 c6 11. Nc3 { which actually leads to transposition in the game }) (9. Qc1 O-O 10. Qb2) 9... O-O 10. cxd5 exd5 11. b4! { a logical and strong positional move. It aims to get a space advantage on the queenside and also, to get a good control of the d4-square for the f3-knight by avoiding c7-c5. } 11... c6 12. Nd4 (12. Qb3 { but maybe Ding was bothered by move like } 12... Bg4 { and was not ready to exchange his bishop quite yet } { [%cal Gg4e2] } 13. Nd4 Ne5) 12... Bh7 13. Qb3 { We are now entering the middle game. To be honest, Ding did not get any advantage from the opening. However, I am sure that he was quite happy with his position. It is going to be a positional game where he seems to have more control than in sharp and complicated positions. } 13... Ne5 (13... Re8 14. Rfc1 Ne4 15. d3 Nd6) (13... Ne4 14. Rfd1 a6 15. Rac1 Re8 16. Nxe4 dxe4 { with terribly passive bishop on h7 but weak white squares for white }) 14. a4 { a normal continuation. White will try to create a minority attack on the queenside. This is often the way to play when you have 2 pawns against 3 on the same side. The general ideas for white here are either to break or weaken the b7-c6-d5 pawn chain by playing b4-b5 or to simply get a good control of the queenside by playing a4-a5. } 14... Rc8 { a prophylactical move in order to play b7-b6 and protect the c6 pawn. } (14... a5! { is a very classical way to play against minority attack. It aims to immediately counter-attack the pawns and stop the a4-a5 plan. } 15. bxa5 (15. b5?! c5 $17 { would be exactly what black wanted }) 15... c5! 16. Nf3 Nxf3+ 17. Bxf3 d4 $13 { would have led to a sharper position. }) 15. a5 b6 { aiming to push c5. Great positional find by Gukesh. It was here that Ding had realized that it is time to play for a draw (as he said in the press conference). } 16. Nf3 { definitely not the most active way to play. } (16. Ba6!? { was an interesting active way to play, but I guess it was not the spirit of the game. } 16... Rc7 17. f4 Ng6 18. Rfc1 { with a double-edge position. }) (16. axb6 axb6 17. f4 Nc4 18. Rfd1 c5 19. bxc5 bxc5 20. Ndb5 Na5 21. Qa3 Nc4 22. Qb3 { resultin in a repetition }) 16... Nxf3+ 17. Bxf3 d4! { the right reaction to simplify the position. If black let white play d4, then the idea of playing c6-c5 would be more difficult to realize. The c6-pawn could then become a long-term weakness. } 18. Ne2 (18. exd4 Qxd4 $15) 18... dxe3 (18... c5 { was also possible } 19. Rfc1 Ne4 20. Qb2 { the position is equal, however } 20... Qh4 { could be an annoying idea }) 19. dxe3 Be4 { the easiest way to simplify the position. } (19... Ne4 { in order to get a double edge position. } 20. Rfd1 (20. Bxe4 Bxe4 $13) 20... Nd2! 21. Qc3 Nxf3+ 22. gxf3 Qe7 $13 { White has theoritically the good tandem (Queen + Knight) but had to weaken the structure for it. The position is very unbalanced and everything can happen! }) 20. Rfd1 Qe7 21. Bxe4 (21. Ng3!? { was the last chance to get an unbalanced position, but I am pretty sure that move did not really cross Ding's mind. } 21... Bxf3 22. gxf3 $13 { White can get some activity thanks to the f5 square and g-file. The pawn structure can be a long term issue but in short term it controls the black knight squares. }) 21... Nxe4 22. axb6 axb6 23. Nc3 { trading the last minor pieces is an implicit way to offer a draw in this position. } 23... Rfd8 24. Nxe4 Qxe4 25. h3 c5 26. Rxd8+ Rxd8 27. bxc5 bxc5 28. Rc1 { Despite black having a passed pawn, white will put pressure on it and Gukesh does not really have a way to take advantage of it. } 28... Qe5 29. Qc2 Rd5 30. g3 f5 31. Kg2 Kh7 32. Qc4 Qd6 33. e4 Re5 34. exf5 Rxf5 35. Qe4 Qd5 36. Qxd5 Rxd5 37. Kf3 Kg6 38. Ke4 Rd4+ 39. Ke3 Rd5 40. Ke4 Rd4+ 41. Ke3 Rd5 42. Ke4 Rd4+ { It seems that both players were not in the mood to take too many risks today, which led to a quite insipid game. But do not worry, it is probably only the calm before the storm for the next games! } 1/2-1/2
