1. Nf3 { Gukesh decides to go for the same opening that brought him a very good game in game 7. } 1... d5 2. c4!? { But this is new in this match ! A risky approach from Gukesh, as he let his opponent taking the full control of the center. } (2. g3 g6 3. c4 c6 { is game 7 of the match. }) 2... d4 { very principled. Ding accepts the challenge to enter Benoni-Benko like positions. } 3. b4!? { And here we go, Gukesh is entering Benkö-like position and seizes space and initiative on the queenside. } (3. e3 { can be another move to get the game position but Black has an interesting alternative } 3... Nc6 (3... c5 4. b4 { is the game. })) 3... c5 { This situation is interesting. One can argue that Black has missed his opening as White got a playable Black opening with a tempo up. However and suprisingly it exists many openings that are much less efficient with tempo up ! It's called "reaction-opening". With tempo down you will adapt to the opponent decisions (pawn structure, pieces organization..) and strangely it isn't a good think to be the first to take such decision. For instance, Dutch, Benkö, Benoni, Grünfeld, King's Indian, are more dubious when they are played as White ! What's the common point between all these openings ? They are strategically dubious and they compensate with dynamics. In all of them you abandon your center and concede some strategical asset : strong center, weak pawns, weak squares... } 4. e3 { and we finally have a Blumenfeld gambit with tempo up ! The Challenger is in a fighting mood and plays very fast. } 4... Nf6 { played after a 38 minutes thought. As he explained at the post-game press conference, Ding has already got this position in a rapid (online) game against Gukesh's countrymate, Adhiban Baskaran, and he started to calculated, i quote "stupid lines". } (4... dxe3 5. fxe3 cxb4 6. d4 { is of course the main way to play the position. Black has won a pawn but has concede the full center. } (6. a3!?) 6... Nf6 7. a3 (7. Bd3 g6! 8. O-O Bg7 9. a3 { 0-1 Demuth,A (2538)-Yu,Y (2743) EU-Cup 33rd Antalya 2017 (4.4) } 9... Nc6! $15) 7... bxa3 8. Bxa3 g6 9. Nc3 Bg7 10. Be2 O-O 11. O-O { and we have a topical position of this opening. White has developped all his pieces and total control of the center for the pawn. }) 5. a3!? { The idea brought by Gukesh's team and almost a Novelty as it has been played only once ! White wants to play a useful move and keep all his options to developp the pieces. } (5. b5 { was the move played by Adhiban } 5... Nbd7!? 6. exd4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 { a very interesting pawn sacrifice for Black, in order to use the weaks squares on c5, d4 and d3. } 7... Nc5 8. Bb2?! (8. Nb3! Nd3+ 9. Bxd3 Qxd3 10. Qe2 { is the best way to play for Black though after } 10... Bf5 11. Bb2 Rc8 12. Na3 Nd7 { Black has a very strong control of central squares and powerfull bishops. }) 8... e5! 9. Nb3 Bf5 10. Nxc5 Bxc5 11. Be2 Qd6 12. O-O h5! { 0-1 Adhiban,B (2660)-Ding,L (2799) Goldmoney Asian Prelim chess24.com INT rapid 2021 (2.8) and Black won a very strong game. A typical example of the "prime Ding". Dynamic opening, strong initiative and powerful play. }) (5. Bb2 dxe3 6. fxe3 cxb4 7. Be2 g6 8. a3 bxa3 9. Rxa3 Bg7 10. Nc3 O-O 11. Qa1 Nc6 12. Nd5 Be6 13. Nxf6+ Bxf6 14. O-O a5 15. d4 Nb4 16.

Ding wants to exchange White's Knight in order to fight against the weak squares. } (5... Nc6 { is more logical. } 6. b5 Na5 7. d3 dxe3 8. Bxe3 b6 9. g3 g6 10. Ra2!? { and the engine prefers Black but the position is very complicated. For instance } 10... Bg7 11. Bg2 Bf5 12. Rd2 O-O 13. h3 Qc7 14. O-O Rad8 15. Re1 { and we got a very tense and unbalanced position. }) 6. exd4 { Gukesh decides to fix the center position and we will got a Benoni-like position ! } 6... cxd4 7. h3! Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Qc7 { here is Ding's idea. He wants to protect his b7 pawn with his Queen in order to play a5 and to get his Nb8 directly to c5. } 9. d3?! { a serious inaccuracy. } (9. c5! { was very logical. White opens the f1-a6 diagonal for his Bf1 and also takes the c5 square for the Knight ! } 9... a5 10. Bb5+! { the key of White's 9th move. } 10... Nc6 11. O-O! axb4 12.

Qf3 Bd6 $13) 9... a5! { quickly played by Ding } 10. b5 Nbd7 { and here Gukesh sank for more than one hour ! White's position is very dangerous, his Queen is misplaced, he has no development, and his b3 square and d3 pawn are very weak. Honestly at this point i wasn't very optimistic of Gukesh's chances to hold the position, Ding has a full control of the position, and a clear plan to follow-up with. Besides, i don't see any forced way for Black to waste his advantage and make a draw by force ! So it means Ding is forced to play for something ! } 11. g3! { not an easy move to make. By putting the Bishop on g2, White accepts that the d3 pawn is doomed. } 11... Nc5 12. Bg2 Nfd7!? { a critical moment. } (12... e5 13. O-O Bd6 { is the other critical position. } (13... a4? 14. Bd2! { [%cal Bd2b4,Gb1d2] }) 14. a4! { White shouldn't allow Black to play it ! } 14... O-O 15. Nd2 Rae8 16. Ba3 b6 17. Rfe1 Qd8 { and Black will slowly organize the f5 push. }) 13. O-O! Ne5 14.

Ncxd3 { looks very natural but } 16. Qe4 Nc5 { White has the very strong manoeuver that we have seen ealier } 17. b6! Qb8 18. Qb1!! { and now it's Black who must be very accurate } 18... Ned7 19. Nb3 Nxb3 20. Qxb3 e5 21. Qb5 Bc5 22. Bg5 Rc8 23. f4!) 16. b6! Qb8 17. Rb1! { a very difficult move to find, and actually it's not the move itself but the concept inducted by 11.g3 ! } 17...

Don't forgot that we are at game 11 of a World Championship, that both players has already consumed a lot of time and we could see on live camera that they were both amazingly nervous. }) 15... g6?! { logical but dubious, the Bishop will be very passive on the diagonal. } (15... e6! 16. a4 Bd6 { and White is in big trouble. For instance : } 17. b6 (17. Qxd4 Nexd3! 18. Rxd3 Nxd3 19. Qxd3 Be5 20. Qa3 Rd1+ 21. Kh2 Bxa1 22. Qxa1 Rxc1 23. Qxg7 Rf8 24.

Something shocking happened at the press conference, Ding considered that he has "no chance" here, which show his very low self-confidence. } 17... Qd6 (17...

Qe2 { not allowing the Bh6 to come to d2 } 26... Re8 27. Na3 { with the idea c5-Nc4. White has the upper hand but Black can try to hold. } (27. h4 { is also a very interesting idea, to put the Bishop on h3 or to push g3-g4 switching the attention to the black Bishop })) 25... Rb8?! (25... Rd6 { was a saving idea ! } 26. Rdb1 (26. Nb3 Re6! { Black wants to chase the Queen from the h1-a8 diagonal. } 27. Qf3 (27. Qh4 Re2 { and Black got active ! }) 27... Rf6 28.

Nxb7 { was objectively stronger. } 28... Nb4 (28... Rxb7 29. Qxc6 Qxc6 30. Bxc6 Ra7 31. Bf3 { and the c-pawn will run. }) 29. Qxd4 $18) 28... Qc8?? { as expected under time pressure. } (28... Nb4! { could have save it all, but with such a mind-set, and time pressure, it was impossible for Ding to pull up any resistance. } 29. Nxb7 Bf8! 30. c5 e5! 31. c6 Re6 32. Qe2 (32. Rc1 Na2!) 32... Nxc6 33. Qc2 Qc8! 34. Nxa5 Nxa5 35. Qxc8 Rxc8 36. Rxa5 Rc3 { White is still better but definitely not winning. }) 29. Qxc6 { i don't know what to say... During the game i thought i was witnessing a very complex and tense game, but after watching the game conference, it was actually a one sided affair, as Ding wasn't able to cope with the intensity of the position and never talked about being better or so.... } 1-0
