{ After two exciting games with some missed chances from both sides, our two champions have decided to play more solidly and calmly today. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3!? { The main difference with 3.Nf3 is that this line avoids the east-Indian defense with 3...b6. However, it gives black the possibility to play 3...c5 and to kind of force a g3-benoni position. } 3... Bb4+ { one of the main moves. } (3... d5) (3... c5) 4. Bd2 (4. Nd2 { is also possible but involves a lot of theory as well. } 4... O-O (4... c5) (4... d5)) (4. Nc3 { exists and would transpose in the famous Carlsen-Niemann game of 2022 (0-1). }) 4... Be7 { the most solid continuation. Black aims to claim that the d2-bishop is less well placed than on c1. } (4... Qe7 { is the old variation but not so famous nowadays. } 5. Nf3 Bxd2+ 6. Qxd2 Nc6 7. a3 $14) (4... a5) (4... c5) 5. Bg2 d5 6. Nf3 O-O { we are now getting a Catalan position. } 7. O-O c6 { a solid line, black will slowly develop all his pieces while getting good control of the center. } (7... Nbd7 { also exists }) (7... dxc4 { is not a really good variation here as the biskop on d2 is already developed } 8. Qc2 a6 9. Qxc4 b5 10. Qc2 $14 { white has a tempo up compared to the classical line of Catalan. }) 8. Qc2 Nbd7 9. Rd1 (9. Bf4 { is the main line, but the nuances are really light. } 9... b6 10. Rd1) 9... b6 10. Bc3!? { not such a famous move and already a big surprise for Ding as he thought for more than 20 minutes here. This move has been tried by Giri against Niemann in August of this year (0-1). The idea is to set the d2-square free for the b1-knight. } (10. Bf4 { is the main line } 10... Bb7 11. Ne5 (11. Nc3!? dxc4 12. Nd2 Nd5 13. Nxc4 Nxf4 14. gxf4 { leads to very complex positions, but engines always think this is ok for black. White has a space advantage but black has the bishop pair and the position remains very solid }) 11... Nh5! { a very thematical move in this kind of position. } 12. Bd2 Nhf6 { Black claims that the position is solid enough to be able to lose one tempo like that. White does not really have a better move than Bf4. They can try } 13. cxd5 cxd5 14. Nc6 Bxc6 (14... Qe8 { is also fine }) 15. Qxc6 Rc8 16. Qb5 Ne8 { but the position is objectively fine for black. }) (10. b3 a5) (10. Nc3 { if black decides to grab the pawn with } 10... dxc4 (10... Bb7) 11. h4!? { leads to very interesting positions, where white is compensating for pawn loss with activity. }) 10... Bb7 (10... Ba6 { is also possible } 11. b3 (11. Ne5 Qc7) 11... Rc8 12. Nbd2 c5 $13) 11. Nbd2 Qc7 12. Rac1 Rfd8 { Ding played only natural moves so far and does not have any problems. } 13. b4 { to play c5 and to bury the b7-bishop. } 13... c5 { the normal reaction now that every black piece is developed. } 14. bxc5 bxc5 15. Qb2 (15. cxd5 Nxd5 16. Ba1 Rac8 { is fine for black. }) 15... Nb6 { many others move are possible, all of them are fine. Nb6 is the most forced one as it attacks the c4-pawn. } (15... Rab8) (15... Rac8) 16. Ba5 { trying to put some pressure with this pin. } 16... dxc4 17. Nxc4 Bxf3?! { not a precise move that could potentially give white a small advantage thanks to the control of light squares. } (17... Nxc4 { is much simpler, forcing the trade of many pieces. } 18. Rxc4 (18. Bxc7 Nxb2 19. Bxd8 Rxd8 $19) 18... Qxa5 19. Qxb7 Nd7 20. dxc5 Rab8 21. Qc6 Rbc8 22. Qb7 Rb8) 18. Bxb6 (18. Bxf3? Nxc4 $19 { the b7-bishop is not hanging anymore. }) 18... axb6 19. Bxf3 Ra6?! (19... Ra7 { was more precise, the rook is less subject to be attacked. } 20. Ne5 Nd5 21. Qb3 $14) 20. Qb5?! { Gukesh once again misses a way to have a comfortable advantage. This move only helps Ding to simplify the position and release the pressure. The game from now on will be very equal without any exciting ideas from both sides. } (20. Ne5! { was clearly a better try. Black's position is very uncomfortable to play. For instance } 20... Nd5 { to avoid Nc6 faces } (20... Bd6 21. Nc6 Rc8 22. e3 Nd5? 23. Bxd5 exd5 24. Nb4!) 21. e4 Nf6 22. Be2! $16 { now we see why the rook is misplaced on a6. The white bishop will come to b5 where it supports the strong c6-square for the e5-knight. }) (20. e3 { would have left Gukesh with a better position. } 20... cxd4 21. Na5!? Ba3! 22. Qxa3 Qb8 23. Rxd4 Rxa5 24. Qd3 Rxd4 25. Qxd4 h6 (25... Rxa2?? 26. Qxb6! $18) 26. a4 $14) 20... Rxa2 21. Nxb6 Qa7 { to leave the vis-Ã -vis on the c-file. Black does not have any issues anymore. } 22. Qb1 (22. dxc5 { is just equal after } 22... Rxd1+ 23. Rxd1 Ra5 24. Qb2 Rxc5 25. Ra1 Ra5 26. Rc1) 22... Rb8 23. dxc5 Ra6 { Ding will now take the c5-pawn followed by the b6-knight and everything will liquidate. } 24. Qb5 Bxc5 25. Qxc5 Qxb6 26. Qxb6 (26. Qc8+ { is not mate thanks to } 26... Ne8!) 26... Raxb6 { I don't think the rest of the game needs a lot of analysis, this is a clear draw position. However, I am a bit surprised by Gukesh's play in this endgame which to me lacked of precision. Fortunately for him, this is such a drawing endgame that it did not have any impact on the result. } 27. Rc6 Rxc6 28. Bxc6 g5 29. Kg2?! { not a mistake by itself but white will have to put the king on f1 on the next move. } 29... Rb2 30. Kf1 Kg7 31. h3 h5 32. Ra1 Rc2 33. Bb5 Rc5 34. Bd3 Nd7 35. f4 { I don't like this move even if once again it does not change the evaluation. It was not forced at all and it only creates weaknesses in white's position. } 35... gxf4 (35... h4 36. fxg5 Rxg5 (36... hxg3 37. h4) 37. gxh4) 36. gxf4 Rc3 37. Kf2 Nc5 38. Ke3 Nxd3 39. exd3 Rc2 40. Kf3 { Obviously, this is a draw, but visually the position looks better for black. } 40... Rd2 41. Ra3 Kg6 42. Rb3 f6 43. Ra3 Kf5 { black cannot really progress otherwise. } (43... Rh2 44. Kg3 Rd2 45. Kf3) 44. Ra5+ e5 45. fxe5 Rxd3+ 46. Ke2 Rxh3 47. exf6+ Kxf6 48. Kf2 h4 49. Kg2 Rg3+ 50. Kh2 Kg6 51. Rb5 Rg5 52. Rxg5+ Kxg5 53. Kh3 Kf5 54. Kxh4 { A quite insipid game. Gukesh's best chance was to try 20.Ne5 but instead he went for a concrete equalizing line. Both players may start to be tired, especially after the last two games which were very fighting ones. } 1/2-1/2
