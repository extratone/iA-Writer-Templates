{Notes by Morphy} 1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 3. Qe2 {For notes on the
opening see the nineteenth game between the same players. }
Nf6 4. d3 Nc6 5. c3 Ne7 {Premature and a loss of time. Black
should have played 5...d6 or 5...O-O. } 6. f4 exf4 {It is
seldom advisable to capture this pawn in the Lopez Gambit.}
7. d4 Bb6 8. Bxf4 d6 {This pawn should have been played to d5
to break up the advanced center pawns. } 9. Bd3 Ng6 10. Be3

{An examination of the position will satisfy the reader that
the retreat of the Knight would have subjected Black to an
attack which would soon have proved irresistible. By thus
sacrificing the exchange, Black in turn assumes the opposite,
the only course which gave promise of a favorable result. }
26. Rxg5 Nf4 27. Qf3 Nxd3 28. d5 {If 28.Qxd3, then follows on
the part of Black, 28...Nxe4, with a won game. } Nxd5 29. Rhg1
{Well played. The game which has now become critical for both
parties is, by both, conducted with skill and judgement. Had
White now played any other move than the one adopted he must
have speedily lost. Suppose first 29.Rxd5 Bxd5 30.Qxd3 Bxe4
31.Nxe4 Qxe4 and Black having five pawns to three, now compels
an exchange of queens, and must win. Or 29.Rxd5 Bxd5 30.exd5
Qe3 31.Qxe3 (best) Rxe3 again winning through his superiority
in pawns. And secondly if 29.Qxd3 Qxg5 30.exd5 Qxd5 and Black
wins. And thirdly, if 29.exd5 Qxg5 30.Qxd3 (best) Qxd5 and we
have the same position as in the last variation. } Nc3+
30. Ka1 {If 30.Kc2 Qxg5 31.Rxg5 (best) Ne1+ 32.Kxc3 Nxf3
33.Nxf3 Rxe4 and Black must win. } Bxe4 31. Rxg7+ Kh8 32. Qg3
Bg6 { This move should have cost Black the game. Black's
proper course was to play 32...Qf6, a move not only productive
of many highly interesting variations, but one which would
have ensured the game. Let us suppose 32...Qf6 33.Rg8+ Kh7
34.Qg7+ ( 34.Rg7+ Kh6 35.Qe3+ Nf4 and Black will win) Qxg7
35.R1xg7+ (35.R8xg7+ Kh6 36.Rxf7 (36.Nxe4 Rxe4 37.Rg8 Re1+
38.Rxe1 Nxe1 and Black again wins.) White may here and
afterwards move differently, but it will be found that, in
every case, Black's superiority in force and position must
secure him the game ...Nb4 37.Rf6+ Kxh5 38.Rc1 (must) Nc2+ and
Black wins) 35...Kh6 36.Rxe8 Nb4 and White cannot prolong the
contest beyond a few moves.. [32...Qf6 33.Rg8+ Kh7 34.Qg7+

Qe1+ 34. Rxe1 {White as suggested by the Chessplayer's
Chronicle (Vo.II.p.361) might now have won in the following
manner. 34.Nb1 Qxg3 35.Rh7+ Kg8 36.gxf7+ Kxh7 37.Rh1+ Kg7
38.fxe8=Q and White easily scores the game. } Rxe1+ 35. Qxe1
