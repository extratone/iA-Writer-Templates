{Notes by J.R. Capablanca} 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bb5
d6 5.d4 Bd7 6.O-O Be7 7.Re1 exd4 8.Nxd4 O-O 9.Bxc6 bxc6 10.Bg5
h6 11.Bh4 Re8 12.Qd3 Nh7 13.Bxe7 {An old move, generally
played by all the masters. I believe, however, that Bg3 is the
best continuation.} Rxe7 14.Re3 Qb8 15.b3 {Unnecessary at this
point, since Black cannot take the pawn.} Qb6 16.Rae1 Rae8
17.Nf3 Qa5 18.Qd2 Ng5 { A very good move which gives Black the
better position.} 19.Nxg5 hxg5 20.h3 Re5 21.Rd1 Bc8 22.Rd3 Qb6
23.Kh2 R8e6 24.Rg3 Rf6 25.Kg1 {f3 would have been answered by
Qc5.} Kf8 26.Na4 Qa5 27.Qxa5 Rxa5 28.Rc3 {Played under the
impression that Black would then have to defend the pawn by
Bd7 when would follow 29.Nc5 Be8 30.e5. Since Black could play
the text move, it would have been better for White to have
played 28.c4.} Bb7 29.f3 Re6 30.Rcd3 Ba6 31.Rd4 f6 32.Rc1 c5
33.Rd2 Bb5 34.Nc3 Bc6 35.a4 Ra6 36.Kf2 Rb6 37.Nd1 Kf7 {Of
course, if c4, Ne3.} 38.Ne3 Rb8 39.Rh1 Ree8 40.Rdd1 Rh8 41.g4
{ Of very doubtful value. It would have been better to play
Kg3, threatening h4.} Bd7 42.Nd5 Rb7 43.Kg3 Rh4 44.Rd3 Be6
45.c4 Rh8 46.Rc1 Ke8 47.Ne3 Kd7 48.Ng2 Rbb8 49.Re1 Kc6 50.Ne3
Rbe8 51.Rb1 Rh7 52.Rd2 Rb8 53.Rd3 Rbh8 54.Rh1 Kb6 55.Rh2 Kc6
{Black goes back with the king because he sees that it would
be impossible for him to go through with it on the queenâ€™s
side, since as soon as the king goes to b4 White drives it
back by checking with the Knight at c2.} 56.Rh1 Rb8 57.Rh2 Rf8
58.Rh1 Kd7 59.Rh2 Bf7 60.Nf5 Rfh8 61.Ne3 Ke6 62.Nd5 Rc8 63.Ne3
{There is no way for Black to breakthrough.} 1/2-1/2
