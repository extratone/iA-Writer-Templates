{ This game was a real rollercoaster. Ding went for a really practical play and was not scared of taking risks. Both had winning advantage at some point and once again both failed to convert as a win. It was not an easy game to analyze as so many different moves and lines were possible to play from both players. I hope you will appreciate it! }
1. c4 { Ding goes for his former love, the English opening. } 1... e5 2. Nc3 Bb4!? { a very modern way to play against the English nowadays. This is kind of a reversed Rossolimo where black is even more flexible as he can choose to put the g8-knight either on f6 or e7. } 3. Nd5 (3. Qb3!? { I tried this move many times as it avoids long theoretical lines. }) (3. g3 Bxc3!? (3... Nf6 { is a reversed Rossolimo. }) 4. bxc3 d6 5. Bg2 f5!? { I like taking advantage of playing f5 as the knight is not on f6. Black's position has a lot of potential, especially some attacking ideas. }) 3... Be7 { probably the best way to play } (3... a5 { is another way to play, Gukesh actually played it against Erigasi in May of 2024. } 4. Nf3 d6 $14) 4. Nf3 (4. d4 { is the main line but engines managed to find a very good way to play for black with } 4... exd4! (4... d6 5. e4 $14) 5. Qxd4 Nf6 6. Nxe7 Qxe7 7. Bg5 Nc6 8. Qc3 d6 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. Qxf6 gxf6 { this position could look better for white as the structure is bad for black. However black will have enough activity to compensate and engines give a clear 0.00 evaluation. }) 4... d6 (4... c6 { is less precise } 5. Nc3! d6 6. d4 $14) 5. g3!? { I like this flexible variation. } (5. d4 { is the main line but } 5... Nf6! { actually gives black a really good position. } 6. dxe5 (6. Nxe7 Qxe7) (6. Nc3 exd4 7. Nxd4 d5!) 6... dxe5 7. Nxe5 Nxd5 8. Qxd5 O-O 9. Bd2 a5!? { black has pretty good compensation for the pawn down thanks to their development advantage. }) 5... c6 (5... Nf6 6. Nc3) 6. Nxe7 (6. Nc3 f5!) 6... Nxe7 7. Bg2 f6 { a logical move to protect e5 to take the center by pushing d5. It surprised Ding as he thought for 15 minutes on this next move. } 8. O-O Be6 9. b3 d5 10. Ba3 { a natural square for the bishop as the diagonal is now open. } 10... O-O { Gukesh's position is really healthy, he objectively equalized here thanks to his good preparation. } (10... dxc4? { is not good for black at all } 11. bxc4 Bxc4 12. d4! { white gets a winning position thanks to a strong initiative and lack of development from black's side. }) 11. Rc1 { a move that came as a surprise for Gukesh as he thought for the first time in the game. } (11. Ne1 { immediately is also possible. } 11... dxc4 12. d4!? { I find this to be a really nice dynamic move! } 12... cxd3 (12... exd4 13. Nf3) (12... cxb3 13. dxe5) 13. Nxd3) (11. d3!? { I also like this idea to play e4 and get a King's Indian structure. } 11... Re8 12. e4 $13) 11... a5!? { Gukesh wants to keep the a5-a4 idea in his pocket. Also, it allows him to get the support of the b4-square after the b8-knight comes to a6. } (11... Re8!? { For instance } { was slightly better according to the engines to get off of this annoying knight pin. This is a normal prophylactical move. } 12. Ne1 Qa5!? (12... Bf7 { is also possible } 13. d4 dxc4 (13... e4 14. Qd2) 14. bxc4 Qxd4 15. Qxd4 exd4 16. Nf3 Nd7) 13. Bxe7 Rxe7 14. cxd5 Bxd5 { Black is perfectly fine. }) 12. Ne1 Re8 13. f4!? { I like that Ding went for this practical move. It is a risky move but it is the first time in the match that Gukesh needs to respond to Ding's active plans. This kind of decision can be a good choice. } (13. Nd3 { was a logical continuation } 13... Na6 14. Nc5 Nxc5 15. Bxc5 Qd7 { but black has no issue here. }) 13... exf4 (13... e4!? { is the other way to choose the structure. However, it gives white a lot of flexible continuations. For instance } 14. cxd5 (14. d3 { is also possible } 14... Nf5 15. Nc2 exd3 16. Qxd3 dxc4 17. bxc4 Na6 $13) 14... Bxd5 (14... cxd5 15. d3 Na6 16. Nc2 $13 (16. dxe4 Qb6+ 17. Rf2 dxe4 18. Bxe4 Nf5 $36)) 15. d3 exd3 (15... Nf5 16. dxe4!? Ne3 17. Qd3 Nxf1 18. exd5 Ne3 19. Be4 f5 20. Bf3 Nxd5 21. Qxf5 $44) 16. Qxd3 (16. e4? Bxe4! 17. Bxe4 Qd4+ $19) 16... Bxg2 17. Kxg2 Qxd3 18. Nxd3 Nf5 19. Rfe1) 14. Rxf4 dxc4 (14... Na6 15. Bxe7 Rxe7 16. cxd5 Bxd5 (16... Rd7!?) 17. Rd4 Nc7) (14... Ng6 15. Rd4 Qb6 16. e3 $13) 15. bxc4 Ng6 16. Re4 { I like Ding's new approach to this game. Although the placement of his pieces may seem a bit superficial, it can give some interesting and tricky positions. } (16. Rf2 Ne5 $15) 16... Na6 { is logical to complete the development } (16... f5!? { was the most aggressive way to play. } 17. Re3 f4 18. Rb3 (18. Re4 fxg3 $17) 18... fxg3 (18... Qc7 19. Rcb1 b6 20. Rxb6 fxg3 21. Rb7 gxh2+ 22. Kh1 Qg3 23. Qb3 Qg4 24. Qf3 Qxc4 25. Nd3 Nd7 26. Bb2 $13) 19. hxg3 Qc7 20. d4 { white gets the center with a good potential. For example some crazy lines can occur like } 20... Bg4 21. d5!? a4 22. Rbc3 Rxe2 23. Bh3! Rg2+! 24. Nxg2 Bxd1 25. Re3 Nd7 (25... Bh5 26. Re8+ Kf7 27. Rf8+! Nxf8 28. Rf1+ Kg6 29. Nh4+ Kh6 30. Nf5+ Kg6 31. Nh4+ { with a crazy repetition. }) 26. d6 Qa5 27. Rxd1 $13 { I would prefer white's position here. }) 17. Nc2 { is more flexible than 17.Nd3 } (17. Nd3 Bf7) 17... Qc7 (17... f5 { is a more concrete way to play. } 18. Rd4 Qc7 (18... Qf6 19. e3 c5 20. Rd6 Rad8 21. Rxd8 Rxd8 22. Qe2 $13 { I would prefer black's position. }) 19. Bd6 Qf7) (17... Ne5 18. Ne3 Nb4 19. d4 (19. Ra1) 19... Nf7 20. d5 { could be interesting for white but } 20... Bh3! { is a strong tactical resource } 21. Qd2 Bxg2 22. Rxe8+ Qxe8 23. Nxg2 c5 $15) 18. Nd4 Bf7 19. d3 Ne5 20. Nf3?! { a too passive move, Ding starts to go back to his old ways. } (20. Nf5!? { immediately was interesting. } 20... Bg6 (20... Rad8 21. Qf1! { followed by Qf4 and Rf1 would give white a strong initiative. }) 21. Nd6 Bxe4 (21... Red8 22. c5! Bxe4 23. Bxe4 { white has pretty good compensation. }) 22. Nxe8 Rxe8 23. Bxe4 { The position is balanced, both sides have chances }) (20. Qd2 { to continue the development was natural } 20... Bg6 21. Rf4 Rad8 22. Bh3!? Bf7 23. Nf5 { white can get some attacking potential }) 20... Nd7?! { And Gukesh does not really try to take advantage of it. } (20... Bg6 21. Rf4 (21. Rd4 Bh5! $15) 21... Nb4 $15 { would give Gukesh a comfortable advantage. }) 21. Rxe8+ Rxe8 22. Rb1? { a big inaccuracy that allows Gukesh to get a good advantage. Ding probably forgot the following move was possible. } (22. Bb2 { to play Bd4 then and centralize the piece was preferable. }) 22... b5! { Gukesh does not hesitate and start to expand on the queenside. } 23. cxb5 (23. Qd2 { it was preferable not to open the diagonal of the f7-bishop even if after } 23... b4 $17 { Black has a great advantage. }) 23... Qb6+ { I assume that was the intermediate move that Ding missed. } 24. Kf1 { The king is not in real danger on f1 and it supports the defense of the e2-pawn. } 24... cxb5 $17 { Gukesh now has a good advantage, the a2-pawn is under attack and the black pawns will be quickly pushed. } 25. Bb2? { a losing move in an already hard position. } (25. Bh3 { white has to try to find an active counterplay } 25... Ndc5 26. Bxc5 Nxc5 27. Qc2 $17 { Obviously the position is not very pleasant for white, but with a precise play Ding can still hold. }) 25... Bxa2 { Gukesh is now a clear pawn up with two linked-passed pawns. } 26. Bd4 Nac5? { Like in yesterday's game, Gukesh does not play precisely in a winning position. It was important to place the other knight on c5. Why do we need to do that with the d7- knight? To make it simple, the main difference remains in the fact that white will not have the Bh3 idea to attack the d7-knight in some lines. } (26... Ndc5! 27. Rc1 Bf7 28. Qc2 Rc8 $19 { and in this precise position, Bh3 is not an issue for black. }) 27. Rc1 Bb3?! (27... Bf7 { is not winning here because of } 28. Qc2 Rc8 29. Bh3! { the annoying move that saves white. } 29... Be6 30. Bxe6+ Qxe6 31. Bf2 Rc7 32. Ra1 a4 33. Nd4 Qh3+ 34. Kg1 Ne5 35. Qa2+ Kh8 36. Qd5 $13) (27... b4! { was still giving black an advantage but I have the feeling Gukesh did not put the effort to calculate the following line } 28. Qc2 b3 29. Bxc5 { does not work because of } (29. Qb2 Na4 30. Bxb6 Nxb2 31. Bd4 Na4 $15) 29... Nxc5 30. Qxc5 b2! $19) 28. Qe1 Be6?? { another huge mistake that now turns the evaluation around! White now has a winning advantage. } (28... Nxd3? { is working because of } 29. Qc3 $18) (28... a4! { Black should take advantage of their passed pawn and not be too slow. } 29. Qb4 (29. Qf2? a3! { is winning for black } 30. Bxc5 Nxc5 31. Qxc5 Qxc5 32. Rxc5 a2 33. Rc1 b4 $19) 29... Qe6! 30. Ng1 Qf5+ 31. Nf3 Qe6) 29. Qf2 Rc8 30. Be3! { threatening d4. } 30... Rc7 (30... Qa6 31. Bxc5 $18) 31. Nd4?! { not the most precise. } (31. Ne1! { a very classy move, that wins on the spot. The threat is to play the inevitable d4-d5 avoiding an intermediate check by black when they take the rook in c1! } 31... Bf7 (31... b4 32. d4 Nb3 33. d5! $18) 32. Bf4 Ra7 33. Bh3! { black will lose a piece. }) 31... Bf7 32. Nc6 Rxc6 33. Bxc6 Qxc6 { White is objectively still winning but black has some annoying counterplay. } 34. Bxc5 h6 35. Ke1 { the safest move, the king has a good spot on d2. } (35. Be3 Qe6 36. Bd4 $18 { White still has to work a lot to convert. }) 35... b4 36. Qd4 (36. Kd2 { looks more logical, I cannot really understand why Ding did not play it. }) 36... Ne5 37. Kd2 Qg2 { Gukesh is trying to create as many threats as possible. } 38. Qf2 Qd5 39. Qd4 { this is understandable to repeat once as Ding wants to reach the 40th move to get extra time. } 39... Qg2 40. Qf2 Qd5 41. Qd4? { a very surprising decision once again by Ding. He reached the time control with a better position, he could have chosen to play on but he decided to repeat to make a draw. } (41. Bd4! { is the way to play for a win. The goal is to trade as many pieces as possible. } 41... Nc6 { to avoid the exchange } 42. Bb6 { threatening Qc5 } 42... Ne5 43. Qd4 Qg2 44. Qf4 $16) 41... Qa2+!? { And Gukesh, true to himself, decides to refuse and play! If both players keep their mind this way, I am sure Gukesh will be rewarded at some point. } (41... Qg2 { would have signed the draw immediately }) 42. Rc2 Qe6 43. Qd8+ (43. Qd6!? { looks very tempting but miraculously black can save the game after } 43... Qh3 44. Bd4 Nf3+!! { the only move! } 45. exf3 Qg2+ 46. Kc1 Qf1+ 47. Kb2 Qxd3 { and this position is a draw! Black will be able to repeat or to have enough compensation thanks to the pawns in order to save the game. }) 43... Kh7 44. Qxa5 { Even if white managed to get a pawn back, black has enough compensation not to be worse now. } 44... b3 45. Rc1 Qd5 46. Qb4 Qg2 47. Qe4+ { this queen exchange kind of forces a draw but any other move would not really differ and could even get dangerous for white. } (47. Bd6 b2! 48. Qxb2 Nf3+ 49. Kc3 Ng1! 50. e4 Ne2+ 51. Kb4 Qf3 $13) 47... Qxe4 48. dxe4 b2 49. Rb1 Ba2! 50. Rxb2 Nc4+ 51. Kc3 Nxb2 52. Kxb2 { The bishop endgame is a dead draw. That game itself was really interesting and different from the games we have seen till now. What did not differ is the fact that Gukesh once again in a winning position lacked precision and did not manage to convert smoothly. Ding also played too shyly even when he had a winning position at some point. Without being mean, we must admit that we could expect a better level for the World Chess Championship, but both players can have a jolt anytime. } 1/2-1/2
