[ChapterName "Gukesh D - Ding, Liren (Navara)"]

{ The first game of a world championship match is always somewhat special. Both players with their teams prepare for several months to surprise their opponent and get promising positions. The initial game of such matches is often a quiet draw, as both players are checking what their opponent has prepared, keeping the biggest surprises and the most dangerous ideas for the later games. It is desirable to learn more about your opponent’s preparation than he learns about yours. That said, this time it was very different, as we saw a fighting game. } 
1. e4 { Gukesh’s main first move is 1.d4, but in such a match 1.e4 cannot be considered a surprise. There was a lot of time to prepare. } 1... e6 { The French Defense is a surprise in my eyes. Ding Liren has mostly been playing 1…e5, but also has many games with 1…c5 and not so few games with 1…c6 in the database. Ding Liren has played the French Defense in a few games, including the 7th game of the World Championship match 2022. Ding eventually lost that game, but it had little to do with the opening. } 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 (3. Nd2 { is considered less dangerous for Black, who should equalize after } 3... c5 { with accurate play. That said, grandmasters Adams, Rublevsky, Tiviakov and some others have been successful with 3.Nd2, as the resulting positions suit their style and allow them to outplay their opponents without entering wild theoretical disputes. }) (3. e5 { has become more popular lately, } 3... c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. Bd3!? cxd4 7. O-O! Bd7 8. Re1 Nge7 9. h4 $44 { being one of the reasons. White has a lead in development, Black's minor pieces struggle to find good squares. White is ready to recapture on c3 with the knight, but can also play Nbd2 and then recapture with the pawn, opening the b-file for the rook. }) 3... Nf6 (3... Bb4 4. e5 c5 { might be a better idea when you need to win a game, it also contains more risks. }) 4. e5 (4. Bg5 dxe4 5. Nxe4 Be7 6. Bxf6 gxf6 { . A recent game Lagarde - Aronian from the Budapest Olympiad 2024 continued with } 7. Nc3!? (7. Nf3 f5 8. Nc3 a6 9. g3 b5 10. Bg2 Bb7 { , when Black will achieve a good play with a timely c7-c5 advance. (It is desirable to pay attention to the d4-d5 ideas in various lines.) }) 7... Nc6 (7... f5 8. Qd2 { allows White to postpone the development of the kingside knight for a better moment. }) 8. Nge2 a6!? 9. g3 e5 10. d5 Na7 11. Qd3 Qd6 12. O-O-O f5 { with mutual chances in a sharp position. Levon went on to win the game in a spectacular way. }) 4... Nfd7 5. f4 (5. Nce2 c5 6. c3 { , when } 6... Nc6 (6... cxd4 7. cxd4 f6 8. Nf4 (8. f4!?) 8... Bb4+ 9. Bd2 Qb6 10. Bxb4 Qxb4+ 11. Qd2 Qxd2+ 12. Kxd2 Ke7 { without giving a clear verdict. It seems that Black should gradually equalize there. }) 7. f4 { transposes. }) 5... c5 6. Nce2 (6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 { Black has numerous options here, } 7... cxd4 8. Nxd4 Qb6 { being arguably the most solid one. It can lead to sharp lines, but If Black does the homework well, it is very hard for White to achieve anything. The main line } 9. Qd2 Qxb2 10. Rb1 Qa3 11. Bb5 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 a6 13. Bxd7+ Bxd7 14. Rb3 Qe7 15. Rxb7 Rc8 (15... Qd8) 16. O-O Qd8 { leads to a position where Black still needs to be careful, but should be able to complete the development and gradually equalize with accurate play. A draw with Black pieces is usually considered a success in a match where the winner takes it all. }) 6... Nc6 (6... cxd4?! 7. Nxd4 $14 { would give White control of the d4-square. Black controls the e4-square, but bringing a knight there causes White no problems at all. The knight on d4 limits Black´s activity and might attack e6 in some lines. Black´s "French bishop" on c8 is passive. }) 7. c3 (7. Nf3 { , but he would most likely have to play c2-c3 sooner or later anyway. The exchange on c5 gives Black extra time compared to the previous note. }) 7... a5!? { An interesting idea. The pawn goes to a4, which gives Black pressure against b2 and control over the light squares c4 and b3 in some lines. The move is not very common in this particular position, but the idea is well-known. Ding spent 28 minutes on this move, choosing between different directions. Black had a plenty of other options as well: } (7... b5?! 8. a3 { looks promising for White. The direct advance } 8... b4? { releases the pressure against d4 and allows } 9. axb4 cxb4 10. f5!? (10. Nf3 $16 { is also good. }) 10... exf5 11. Nf4 Nb6 12. Nf3 { with a huge compensation. }) (7... Qb6 8. Nf3 f6) (7... Be7 8. Nf3 O-O { , when Black can choose between f7-f6, b7-b5-b4, Qd8-b6 and not only. In general, Black would like to play Qb6, f7-f6, exchange on d4 and e5, sacrifice a piece for two pawns on e5 or an exchange for the d4-pawn on f3 to undermine White's centre and attack the king, but it might also backfire. If White manages to protect the king, the f7-f6 advance might seriously weaken the e6-pawn and the subsequent sacrifices on e5 or elsewhere might also backfire. }) 8. Nf3 (8. a4 Qb6! { Black could choose the proper moment to exchange on d4. It should be done at a moment when White cannot develop his knights on f3 and c3. It is not easy to suggest a move for White after } 9. Nf3 Be7 { . While } 10. Be3 { would be the most natural one, taking on b2 becomes an option. I am not sure if it works right now, but Black can also start with } 10... O-O { . White would like to castle kingside, but it is easier said than done. }) 8... a4 9. Be3 (9. g4!? { in a rapid game back in 1998, but it looks very risky, given that Black has not castled yet. }) (9. a3?! { removes the a4-a3 ideas, it also irreparably weakens the squares b3 and c4. Black can continue } 9... Be7 { with a good play. }) 9... Be7 10. g4!? { Gukesh played this very quickly. If White won the game, perhaps I would praise this move, but given the result, I am sceptical about it. Gukesh aims for a sharp position and prepares a desirable f4-f5 advance, but opening the centre with an unsafe king on e1 can also backfire. } (10. dxc5 O-O 11. Ned4 Nxc5 12. Bd3!? { , as the exchange on d3 would leave Black with a bad bishop on c8. It is not a big problem, though. } (12. Be2 Bd7 { looks approximately equal. })) 10... Qa5 (10... O-O { looks dangerous, there might be some reason why engines like it. } 11. g5!? (11. f5? { screams to be played in blitz, it is surprisingly bad: } 11... a3 12. b3 cxd4 13. cxd4 f6! 14. fxe6 fxe5! 15. exd7 Rxf3!? 16. dxc8=Q Rxc8 { with a crushing attack. Don't try this at home! }) 11... b5! 12. dxc5 Nxc5 13. Ned4 Qb6 { probably gives Black a good play, as the b5-pawn is half-poisoned: } 14. Nxc6 Qxc6 15. Nd4 Qb6 16. Bxb5?! Ba6 17. Bxa6 Qxa6 $15 { Black has prevented White's castling for the moment, has overtaken initiative and his knight is very strong as well. That said, Gukesh has certainly prepared something better. }) 11. Bg2 { White also started thinking, spending 20 minutes on this move. } 11... a3?! (11... b5 12. dxc5 b4 13. Nfd4 Bb7) (11... Nb6 12. Qc2 (12. O-O Nc4 13. Bc1 $13) 12... Nc4 13. Bf2 b5!? 14. dxc5 b4 { , perhaps the most logical one. Black is doing well here. }) 12. b3! cxd4 13. b4! { The point. White brings his knight to d4 now, keeping his pawn structure relatively compact. } 13... Qc7 14. Nexd4 Nb6 { Ding spent 18 minutes on this move and was almost an hour behind at this point. } 15. O-O (15. Nb5! Qd8 16. Bf1! { was interesting, preventing Nb6-c4. Black could try } 16... Bd7 (16... d4!? 17. Nfxd4 Nd5) 17. Qd2 d4!? 18. Nbxd4 Nxd4 19. Bxd4 (19. Nxd4?! Bh4+! 20. Bf2 Bxf2+ 21. Qxf2 Rc8 22. Rc1 Nd5 $15 { leaves White with many weaknesses. }) 19... Bc6 { with some compensation. }) 15... Nc4 16. Bf2 Bd7 { Black makes a useful developing move and correctly postpones castling. If White prepared the f4-f5 advance, the king could feel uneasy on g8. } 17. Qe2 { Gukesh spent 34 minutes here. The differences between concrete moves were not so big here, the real challenge is to make your plans work while preventing the ideas of your opponent. Please do not ask me how to achieve that... } 17... Nxd4! 18. Nxd4 Nb2! { A very strong idea. (I vaguely remember having seen a similar motif in New in Chess in a game annotated by Anish Giri several years ago, but my memory might deceive me.) Black attacks the c3-pawn. White can protect the weakness in various ways, but they are all connected with some concessions. } 19. Qe3 (19. Rac1?! { is inaccurate in view of } 19... Qc4! 20. Qxc4 Nxc4! $15 { . Without the queens Black can safely castle kingside, after which White will have to protect his weak pawns c3, a2 and the square e4. }) (19. Qf3 Rc8 20. Rfc1 { , possibly even with some f4-f5 ideas, but it looks weird to move the rook from f1 and then play for f4-f5. At the very least, } 20... Qc4? { can be met with } 21. Bf1! { and 20...h5? 21.gxh5 is not an option, either. }) 19... Rc8 20. Rac1 (20. Be1!? { was a bit more accurate, keeping the a2-pawn protected. That said, } 20... h5!? 21. g5 (21. gxh5 Rxh5 { also looks good for Black, who will play g7-g6 later on to prevent f4-f5. }) 21... g6 { looks very good for Black, whose king is safer than ever before. My engine claims equality after } 22. Rf3! Qb6 23. Bf1 { , but it is already White who should be more careful. }) (20. Rfc1 h5! 21. g5 g6 { , Black's position is easier to play. }) 20... Qc4! 21. f5?! { This active move weakens the e5-pawn. } (21. Rfe1 Qd3! (21... Qxa2? 22. Bf1! Nc4 23. Qf3 { leaves Black's queen in trouble, as } 23... Nd2 { loses the knight to } 24. Qe2! $18 { . }) 22. Bf1! Qxe3 23. Bxe3 Nc4 24. Bf2 { . }) 21... Qd3! { This queen sortie is surprisingly strong. } (21... Qxa2?? 22. f6 Bf8 23. Nf5!! { (The best move, but not the only good one.) } 23... exf5 24. e6! fxe6 25. gxf5 gxf6 26. fxe6 Bc6 27. e7! Bxe7 28. Rce1 Rc7 29. Qf4 $18 { with a crushing attack. Apart from Rc7, f6 is also hanging, and Black's king lacks at least two defenders, Qa2 and Nb2. }) 22. Qe1?! { With a weak pawn on e5, the queen exchange looks even more depressive than before. } (22. Qf4 g5! { Did Gukesh miss or underestimate this move from afar? } 23. fxg6 (23. Qg3 $17 { looks very sad. }) 23... Qxg6! { leaves White's position in ruins, e.g. } (23... hxg6?! 24. Be3 Rh7 $17 { is also good for Black. }) 24. Qf3 h5!? (24... Nd3 { , either. }) 25. gxh5 Qxh5 { , when White is strategically lost with so many pawn weaknesses (c3, e5, a2, h2). }) (22. g5! { was the best chance, hoping to attack the e6 or to employ the f5-f6 idea at the right moment. White has counterplay after } 22... Qxe3 (22... g6 23. fxe6 fxe6 24. Bh3) 23. Bxe3 Nd3 24. Rcd1! Nxe5 (24... Rxc3? 25. fxe6 fxe6 26. Ne2 Rc2 27. Rxd3 Rxe2 28. Rxa3 $14 { is already dangerous for Black in view of the threat of 29.Ra8+. }) 25. Bf4 Nc6 26. Nb5 { , for instance } 26... Nxb4 27. Nc7+! Rxc7 28. Bxc7 Nxa2 29. Be5 Bxg5 30. Ra1 { . }) 22... Bg5! { Now Black has a huge advantage. } 23. Rc2 (23. Nb3 { , hoping to bring his queen to g5 to generate some counterchances. But Black can even play } 23... Qc4! { , threatening 24...Nd3 in the first row. White's position is already beyond saving. }) 23... Rc4 { Threatening to take on d4 and c2. } (23... O-O!? { , but Ding's solution is also very good and looks safer. }) 24. h4 Bf4 25. Qb1! { The best defense against 25...xd4. } 25... Rxc3 26. Rxc3 Qxc3 27. fxe6 fxe6?! (27... Bxe6! 28. Ne2 Qxe5 29. Nxf4 Qxf4 { , as } 30. Bc5 Qxg4 31. Rf3 Nc4! 32. Qb3 b5 33. Rg3 Qxh4 { gives White nothing. But it could look dangerous over the board. }) 28. Ne2! Qxe5 29. Nxf4 Qxf4 30. Qc2? { Being slightly short of time, Gukesh spent over 6 minutes here, but did not choose the right move. } (30. Bc5! Qxg4 { , and now either 31.Rf3 or 31.Qc2: } 31. Rf3! (31. Qxh7? { fails to a brilliant rejoinder } 31... Qd4+!! 32. Bxd4 (32. Kh2?! Qxh4+ 33. Qxh4 Rxh4+ 34. Kg3 Rh8 $19) (32. Rf2? Qxf2+! $19) 32... Rxh7 33. Bc5 Rh8 34. Rf3 Nc4 $19 { , when Black is simply two pawns up. }) (31. Qc2! { (threatening 32.f2) } 31... Nc4 32. Qf2 Kd8 33. Bb6+ Nxb6 34. Qxb6+ Ke8 35. Qd6! { , again with good counterchances. }) 31... Nc4 32. Qf1! (32. Qxh7? { again loses to } 32... Qd4+!!) 32... Kd8! 33. Qf2 $15 { with good practical counterchances, as Black's king is weak. Black is three pawns up, but the endgame is far. }) 30... Qc4! 31. Qd2 O-O! { Black is two pawns up and only needs to contain White's activity. Ding converts the advantage very smoothly. } 32. Bd4 { White would like to attack Black's king, but it fails tactically. } 32... Nd3! { The only winning move. I assume that Gukesh missed something in this line when deciding on 30.Qc2. } 33. Qe3 Rxf1+ 34. Bxf1 e5! { The only move, but not difficult to find. } 35. Bxe5 (35. Bxd3 Qxd4 36. Qxd4 exd4 { is completely hopeless, } 37. g5 Ba4 38. Kf2 Bb3! 39. Bb1 (39. axb3 a2 $19) 39...

Bh3 Qd1 40. Bd6 Qc2+ 41. Kg3 Qxa2 42. Be6+ Kh8! { Ding pays attention till the end. } (42... Kh7?? { would have allowed White to save the game after } 43. Qxe4+! dxe4 44. Bxa2 { . }) 43. Qxe4 Qf2+ { . It was a great game by Ding Liren, who scored a very important win with Black pieces! The world champion had been struggling recently, it is very good to see him back in form again. The prognoses based on recent results might be misleading, as it is the current form (and preparation) what decides. The 18-year-old Indian prodigy has played his first World Championship game. It did not go well, but one game does not mean that much. It will be interesting to see who will take more risks in the next game. Ding Liren is going to play with White while Gukesh is trailing him by one point and needs to win sooner or later to level the score. The whole match is ahead and anything can happen, with 13 games left. While it is very difficult to win a game at the top level, I expect to see many fighting games in this match. It sounds promising for the spectators! } 0-1
