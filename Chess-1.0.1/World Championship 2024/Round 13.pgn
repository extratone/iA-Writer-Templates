{ The last White game for Gukesh in this match (at least for classical time control). Everyone is very curious to see how the young Challenger will deal with the scenario. For my part, i was curious to see Ding's mindset... }
1. e4! { The exclamation point is for the courage. Gukesh is willing to use his last White with a sharp game. } 1... e6 { And this one as well ! Ding sticks to his French defence, not worried about facing another new idea at this decisive point of the match. } 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 { Nothing new so far, The Steinitz variation of the French was at the menu of the 1st game of the match ! } 4... Nfd7 5. Nce2!? { A new move order from move one } (5. f4 c5 6. Nce2 { was the dramatic 1st game of the match. }) 5... c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. a3!? { a very rare move but very interesting one. White is keeping a lot of flexibility in the development, forcing his opponent to anticipate all the move order nuances. } (7. f4 { is of course the main move. }) (7. Nf3 { followed by a2-a3 is more fashionable. }) 7... Be7 { a very logical move played after a long thought. } (7... f6 { is also very interesting. } 8. Nf4 { threatening e6 and Qh5+ } (8. f4?! { trying to hold the center is not so clear } 8... fxe5 (8... Be7 9. Nf3 O-O 10. b4 cxd4 11. Nexd4 (11. cxd4? b5!! { with the idea a7-a5 is terrible for White. }) 11... Nxd4 12. cxd4 f5! { and Black will try to invade the Queenside weakened squares with Nb6-Bd7 }) 9. dxe5 (9. fxe5? cxd4! 10. cxd4 Qh4+ 11. g3 Qe4 $19) 9... c4!? { followed by Nc5-Qb6-Bd7 looks very pleasant for Black. }) 8... Qe7 (8... fxe5? { it's interesting to compare this possibility to the one with 7...cxd4 } 9. Qh5+ Ke7 10. dxe5! Ndxe5 11. Nxd5+! Qxd5 12. Bg5+ Kd7 13. Rd1 { wins the Queen ! }) 9. exf6 Qxf6 10. Nf3 Bd6 11. Nh5 Qg6 12. dxc5! Nxc5 13. Ng3 O-O 14. Be3 b6 15. b4 Nd7 16. Be2 { and White's position looks more harmonious. }) (7... cxd4!? { can be an improvment. } 8. cxd4 f6 9. exf6 (9. Nf4 fxe5! 10. Nxe6 (10. Qh5+ { but here it doesn't work } 10... Ke7 11. dxe5 Ndxe5 12. Ng6+ (12. Nxd5+ Qxd5 13. Bg5+ Kd7 14. Rd1 Nd4! $19) 12... hxg6 13. Qxh8 Kf7 { threatening Bb4+ } 14. Bd2 Nd4! { with a very nice game for Black. })) 9... Nxf6 { is also playable. } (9... Qxf6 10. Nf3 Bd6 11. Ng3 e5! 12. dxe5 Ndxe5 13. Qxd5 Nxf3+ 14. gxf3 Qe6+ 15. Qxe6+ Bxe6 { with very good compensations for Black. }) 10. Nf3 Bd6 11. g3 O-O 12. Bg2 Qa5+! 13. Bd2 Qb6 14. O-O { with an unclear position. }) (7... a5 { in the spirit of the 1st game looks dangerous without analyze } 8. h4! a4 9. Nf3 Qa5 10. Bf4 { to capture on d4 with a Knight } 10... Be7 11. Qc2 { to meet 11...0-0 with Ng5 } 11... f6 12. exf6 Nxf6 13. g3 O-O 14. Bg2 { and here Black shoud go for } 14... cxd4 15. Nexd4 Nxd4 16. Nxd4 Ng4! 17. Nf3 e5! 18. Nxe5 Bd6! 19. Nxg4 Bxg4!! (19... Bxf4 { is easier ;) }) 20. O-O (20. Bxd6 Rae8+ 21. Kf1 Re2 22. Qxe2 Bxe2+ 23. Kg1! { is very complicated has White got the very simple play to put the Bishop on d4, and play against Black weaknesses. Scary to me ! }) 20... Bxf4 21. gxf4 Rxf4 22. Qd2 Rf5 23. Rae1 Bf3 { and we are getting closer to the equality. But i can't blame Ding to go there :) }) 8. Be3!? { A real novelty played very quickly. } 8... Nb6!? { a very strange move which costed more that 30 minutes to the World Champion. } (8... a5 { looks interesting now (the Bishop is not on f4 !) } 9. Nf4 Qb6 { and i think Gukesh would have choose } 10. Bd3!? cxd4 (10... Qxb2 11. Nge2 Qb6 12. O-O { and we have a very dangerous position for Black. All White pieces are ready for the dynamic, while Black's are still searching for coordination. }) 11. cxd4 Nxd4 12. Rb1! a4 { to unpin with Qa5 } 13. Qg4! Qa5+ 14. Kf1 Nb3 15. Qxg7 Rf8 16. Nf3 d4! 17. Nxd4 Qxe5 18. Qxe5 Nxe5 19. Bb5+ Bd7 20. Bxd7+ Kxd7 { i am 100% sure that Gukesh seconds had this position in their lines. } 21. Nxb3 axb3 22. Rd1+ Bd6 23. h4 Nc4 24. Bc1 Rfd8 25. Rh3 Ke8 26. Rxb3 { and here Black has } 26... Bxa3! 27. Rxd8+ Rxd8 28. Nd3! Be7 29. Ke2 b6 (29... Bxh4 30. Rb4! b5 31. b3! Be7 32. Rxb5 (32. bxc4 Bxb4 33. Nxb4 Rd4 $17) 32... Nd6 33. Rh5 { and it's still very playable ! I wanna bet they have this ;) })) (8... cxd4 9. cxd4 b5! { was probably the best choice according to the engine, but not easy to find ! } 10. Nf3 Qb6 11. b3 Qa5+ 12. Bd2 Qb6 13. h4 f6 { with a sharp game to come }) 9. Nf4 { going to the h5 square ;) } 9... cxd4 (9... Bd7 { was another idea to use the Nb6 move, trying to get the White squares, but the Kingside is a big lonely ! } 10. Nf3 c4 11. h4 h6 { to avoid Ng5-Qh5 } 12. Nd2 { letting space to the Qd1 to the Kingside } 12... Na5 13. Qg4 Rg8 14. Be2 { and Black is in trouble as } 14... Qc7 { falls into } 15. Ng6!! fxg6 16. Qxg6+ Kd8 (16... Kf8 17. Rh3! $18) 17. Qf7 Re8 18. Qxg7 { collecting all the pawns on the Kingside, with the tricky plan to push all of them to the 8th rank ! } 18... Ba4! 19. Bxh6 Bc2 20. f4 { position is still super complicated but i prefer to play it on White's side. }) 10. cxd4 Nc4?! { a very dubious plan. } 11. Bxc4 dxc4 { From a positional point of view, Black is doing very well with his two bishops, his queenside majority and the backward d4 pawn. But White counts on the dynamic and space to make the decision in his favor. } 12. Nge2 (12. Qg4 { was very critical for Black setup. Gukesh didn't like } 12... Qa5+ 13. Bd2 Qb6 { and we have a real mess on the board after } (13... Bb4 { is also a try but White is much better after } 14. Rd1 Bxd2+ 15. Rxd2 Rg8 16. Nge2 Bd7 17. Nc3 O-O-O 18. Qe2 $16) 14. Qxg7 Rf8 15. Nge2 Nxd4 16. Nxd4 Qxd4 17. Be3! Qe4 18. O-O-O c3! 19. Rd3 cxb2+ 20. Kxb2 Bd7 21. Rc1! Qa4 22. Qxh7 { and the engine is giving White an almost winning advantage, but again it's easy to miss something during the calculation of those crazy lines (it's just a sample !) }) 12... b5 (12... f6 { was a very interesting choice } 13. exf6 Bxf6 14. O-O e5! 15. Nh5 exd4 16. Nxf6+ Qxf6 17. Nxd4 O-O 18. Nxc6 Qxc6 { and White is still doing better despite the opposite color bishop. He will play f2-f3 to control the white squares, then put his bishop of c3 via d2 or d4 and then play on the e-fil. Of course Black has very good drawing chances, but is on the wrong side of the draw :) }) 13. O-O O-O 14. Nc3 Rb8 15. Nh5 { threatening Qg4 so } 15... f5 { very radical ! } (15... Kh8 16. Qg4 Rg8 { was the passive way to defend the threat. } 17. Rfd1 $14) 16. exf6 Bxf6 17. Qf3?! { not the best way ! } (17. Nxf6+ Qxf6 18. d5! { is the right way to use the Black's lack of development. } 18... exd5 19. Qxd5+ Qe6 20. Rfd1 Qxd5 21. Rxd5 a6 22. Rc5 { with a strong pressure. White will try to developp the initative on the kingside and the Black squares, his rook on c5 paralyze totaly the queenside majority. }) 17... Qe8!? { unexpected ! } (17... Nxd4 18. Nxf6+ Rxf6 19. Qd1 e5 20. Bg5 { was probably Gukesh's idea but Black has } 20... Bf5! 21. Re1 (21. Bxf6 Qxf6 { followed by Bd3-Re8 e4 is good for Black }) 21... Qe8! (21... Nc2 22. Rxe5! Nxa1 23. Qxa1 h6 24. Bxf6 Qxf6 25. Qe1 { and White can play for an edge }) 22. Bxf6 gxf6 { Black has the plan to play Kh8 and put all the piece on the White king, Scary ! }) 18. Nxf6+ Rxf6 { both players are equal on time. } 19. Qe2 Qg6 20. f3! { i like this move to cut all Black's ideas along the diagonal and securing the e4 square for his Knight } 20... Rf8 { Anticipe un Ce4. } 21. Rad1 Ne7?! { very logical, but it's in Gukesh scope to punish it with } (21... b4 { was forced ! }) 22. Bf4! Rb6 (22... Rxf4? 23. Qe5 { attacking both rooks ! }) 23. Bc7 Rb7?! { Ding admits at the press conference that he missed Bf4. Now Black is totally discoordonated and the White bishop has invade black camp. } 24. Bd6 Re8 25. Bxe7 { a logical move, White wants the Knight against Bishop fight, with the strong e5 square in his hand. } (25. Rfe1 { looks to be more dangerous for Black. } 25... Nf5 26. Bb4 Bd7 27. Qe4 Rbb8 28. d5! exd5 29. Qxd5+ Be6 30. Qd2 Bf7 31. Ne4 { with a superb position, all White pieces are centralized. }) 25... Rexe7 26. Qe5!? a6 { from an engine perspective, Gukesh has lost some of his advantage, but with such a little time his position is very pleasant to play. } 27. d5 { very concrete, but i am not so sure from a practical point of view } (27. Rfe1 { Followed by Re4 then h4-h5, keeping Black position under the bind. }) 27... exd5 28. Qxd5+ Qe6! { the good defense } (28... Qf7?! { allow } 29. Qc6 Re8 30. Qxa6) 29. Qc5 Re8! { Ding is very precize so far, he needs just one tempo to complete his harmonization. } 30. Rde1 Qf7?? { and the blunder comes ! } (30... Qxe1 { was the only way to fight } 31. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 32. Kf2 Re8 33. Ne4 Rbe7 34. Nd6 Re5! 35. Qc6 R5e6 36. Qc5 Re5 37. Qc7 R5e7 38. Nxe8 Rxc7 39. Nxc7 { and this ending needs to be calculated as the White king is closer ! } 39... Kf7 40. Ke3 Ke7 41. Kd4 Kd7 42. Nd5 Kd6 43. Ne3 { Black should hold but White will definitely try ! }) 31. Ne4? { and Gukesh misses the KO !! } (31. Rxe8+ Qxe8 32. Ne4! { was completely winning ! } 32... Qd7 33. Nd6 Rb8 (33... Rc7 34. Qd5+! Kh8 35. Re1 $18) 34. Qd5+ Kf8 (34... Kh8 35. Nf7+ Kg8 36. Nh6+ Kf8 37. Qg8+ Ke7 38. Re1+ Kd6 39. Rd1+ $18) 35. Rd1! Bb7 36. Qe5 Qe7 37. Nxc4! { the point with a very easy win, the Bb7 isn't useful at all ! }) 31... Rf8! { the right defense ! Such a tense moment it can be the turning point of the match ! } 32. Nd6 Rc7! { the key move of the defense ! } 33. Qe5 Qf6! 34. Qd5+ Kh8 35. Re5 Re7 (35... Bb7! 36. Nxb7 Rxb7 37. Re6 Qf7 38. Rd1 a5 { and Black is out of danger ! }) 36. Rfe1! Rxe5 37. Rxe5 (37. Qxe5 { was an interesting try ! } 37... Qxe5 38. Rxe5 Kg8 39. Rc5 Bd7 40. Rc7 Bf5 41. Kf2 { and White keeps all the chances to put pressure. }) 37... h6! { The king is finally breathing ! } 38. Qc5 Bd7 39. Ne4 Qf4 40. Re7 Bf5 { Time control is done and the position is equal. } (40... Bc6!?) 41. Qd4 Rg8 { the only move. } 42. h3 Qc1+ 43. Kf2 Bxe4 44. Rxe4 { Ding still has to be careful as White heavy pieces are dominating, but he found a very nice way to force the draw } 44... c3!? { transposing to a very easy endgame. } 45. bxc3!? (45. Qxc3 Qxc3 46. bxc3 Rc8) 45... Qxa3 46. Kg3 Qb3 47. Re7 a5 48. Rb7 Qc4 49. Qe5 (49. Qxc4 bxc4 50. Ra7 Rb8 51. Rxa5 Rb3 52. Rc5 Rxc3) 49... Qc6! { very well played by Ding } 50. Qxb5 Qxc3 51.

Gukesh has used all his guns to try his last White game, after confusing the World Champion with a very interesting setup in the opening, he applied a huge pressure on Black's position, pushing Ding to the mistake but didn't use it ! A major upset for the young challenger and a small victory for Ding ! } 1/2-1/2
