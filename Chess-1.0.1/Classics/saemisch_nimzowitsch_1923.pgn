{Notes from Nimzowitsch's "My System"} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3
b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. Ne5 c6
{Safeguards the position} 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bf4 a6 {Protects
the oupost station c4, i.e., by ...a6 and ...b5.} 11. Rc1 b5
12. Qb3 Nc6 {The ghost! With noiseless steps he presses on
towards c4.} 13. Nxc6 {Samisch sacrifices two tempi (exchange
of the tempo-eating Knight on e5 for the Knight which is
almost undeveloped) merely to be rid of the ghost.} Bxc6
14. h3 Qd7 15. Kh2 Nh5 {I could have supplied him with as yet
a second ghost by ...Qb7 and ...Knight-d7-b6-c4, but I wished
to turn my attention to the King's side.} 16. Bd2 f5 {!}
17. Qd1 b4 {!} 18. Nb1 Bb5 19. Rg1 Bd6 20. e4 fxe4 {! This
sacrifice, which has a quite surprising affect, is based upon
the following sober calculation: two Pawns and the 7th rank
and an enemy Queen's wing which cannot be disentangled - all
this for only one piece!} 21. Qxh5 Rxf2 22. Qg5 Raf8 23. Kh1
R8f5 24. Qe3 Bd3 25. Rce1 h6 {!! A brilliant move which
announces the Zugzwang. White has not a move left. If, e.g.,
Kh2 or g4, then R5f3. Black can now make waiting moves with
his King, and White must, willy-nilly, eventually throw
himself upon the sword.} 0-1
