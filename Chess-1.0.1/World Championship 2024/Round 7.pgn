{ An very interesting game to analyse in this 7th round. With a great opening idea, Gukesh is promising us a fighting game. }
1. Nf3 { Gukesh gives 1.Nf3 a try in this game after having played 1.e4 twice and 1.d4 once. } 1... d5 2. g3 g6!? { an interesting way to play against the Reti which may give a symmetrical g3-grunfeld. } 3. d4 (3. Bg2 Bg7 4. d4 (4. O-O { is the other main way to play, white lets black to take the center in order to get more flexibility. } 4... e5 5. d3 Ne7 6. e4 { leading to king-Indian positions. } (6. c4 c6 7. Nc3 O-O { is also possible. })) 4... Nf6 5. c4 c6 { transposes to the game. }) 3... Bg7 4. c4 c6 (4... dxc4 { is the other fundamental way to play. } 5. Qa4+!? { could be the main reason why white would play 3.d4 first instead of 3.Bg2. However, we cannot really know what Gukesh had in mind here. } (5. Na3 c5 $15) (5. Nc3 { not to take back the pawn immediatey is often an interesting way to play. White will mostly focus on taking a good control of the center and get active pieces. } 5... Nf6 6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O c6 { transposes to one of the main lines of symmetrical grunfeld. } (7... Nc6!? $13)) 5... Nc6 (5... Qd7 6. Qxc4) (5... Bd7 6. Qxc4) 6. Bg2 Nf6 (6... Qd7!? 7. Qxc4 Nxd4 8. Nxd4 Bxd4 9. Nc3 c6 10. Bf4 $36 { white gets a strong initiative. }) 7. Ne5 O-O 8. Nxc6 bxc6 9. Qxc4 Be6 10. Qxc6 Qxd4 11. Nc3 { leads to an unclear position, white having a better structure but black having a good activity of pieces. }) 5. Bg2 Nf6 { We are now getting the famous symmetrical Grunfeld, an opening I appreciate from both colors as it actually has a lot of potential. Many ideas have already been tried with the white pieces to play against this solid structure. Gukesh has decided to come to the game with a new one! } 6. O-O O-O 7. Re1!? { a very rare move, and it is always a pleasure to see a quasi-novelty after only 7 moves in such a theoretical opening. Only 31 games have been played here and only one grandmaster played in twice, the German GM Rasmus Svane. It obviously came as a surprise to Ding as he thought for almost 30 minutes here! A good point for Gukesh. Many other moves were possible for white here: } (7. cxd5) (7. Nc3) (7. b3) (7. Qb3) (7. Nbd2) (7. Ne5) (7. a4) (7. Qa4) (7. Na3) 7... dxc4!? { Ding goes for the pawn and accepts to give white the central squares. } (7... Bf5 { Probably the most solid and logical one. Hard to know again what Gukesh had in his preparation as many ideas are possible. } 8. Nc3!? { maybe the most aggressive idea. I would assume it was Gukesh's one. } (8. Nh4 Be6) (8. Qb3!? { to put pressure on the b7-pawn. } 8... Qb6 { any other move would be too passive. } (8... Qc7 9. Nc3 Rd8 10. Bf4 $14) (8... Qc8 9. Nc3 Rd8 10. cxd5 cxd5 11. Bf4 $14) (8... b6? 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Ne5! $16) 9. Nc3 $13 { transposes to some 7.Qb3 lines. }) 8... dxc4! { the best move according to computer, any other moves give white a confortable advantage. It is hard to play if you did not play it before as after } (8... Ne4 9. Qb3 $16) (8... Nbd7 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Qb3 $14 Qb6? 11. Nxd5! Qxb3 12. Nxe7+ $18) (8... Na6 9. h3!? $14) 9. e4 { white is winning a tempo compared to the 7.Nc3 line. } 9... Bg4 10. h3 Bxf3 11. Bxf3 $13) 8. e4 Bg4 { the most logical move in order to complete the development. } (8... Na6!? { is also possible. } 9. Na3!? b5 10. Nc2 Nc7 11. b3!? { a thematic idea to open the queenside for the white rooks and put pressure on the a8 rook. } 11... cxb3 12. axb3 $44) 9. Nbd2!? { now we can see the main difference between the 7.Nc3 line and this one. White is now free to put the knight on d2 to attack the c4-pawn. } 9... c5 { an interesting decision, Ding decides to play active and not focus on protecting his c4 pawn. After that move, Gukesh was out of his preparation. } (9... b5 { is the normal continuation. White will have strong compensation for the pawn. } 10. h3 Bc8! (10... Bxf3 11. Nxf3 Nbd7 12. e5 Nd5 13. e6 N7b6 14. exf7+ Rxf7 15. Ng5 $14 { is very unpleasant for black }) 11. a4 a5 12. Nf1!? Nbd7 13. Ne3 Nb6 (13... Nxe4 14. Ng4 Nd6 15. Nfe5 $36) 14. Qc2!? Bb7 (14... Nxa4 15. Nxc4! $16) 15. Bd2 { white has a strong attacking potential, they will play h4 followed by e4-e5. }) 10. d5 { Gukesh could now claim he has a clear advantage thanks to his strong center, but he has to be precise on his next move. } 10... e6 11. h3 { A logical move, Gukesh wants to force Ding to give his bishop pair, but lets go of a big part of his advantage. } (11. Nxc4! $16 { immediately was the right move but not easy to play at all. } 11... exd5 (11... Nxe4? { does not work as the b7-pawn will be lost. } 12. Rxe4 Bxf3 13. Bxf3 exd5 14. Re1 dxc4 15. Bxb7) 12. exd5 Qxd5!? { the move Gukesh was probably afraid of } (12... Nxd5? { the pawn is not really takable this way } 13. h3! Be6 (13... Bxf3 14. Qxf3 $18) (13... Bc8 14. Bg5 Nf6 15. Nfe5 $18 { white has a winning positional advantage. }) 14. Ng5 $18) (12... Nbd7 13. h3 Bxf3 14. Qxf3 $16) 13. Qxd5 Nxd5 14. Ng5! { we are now entering a very long forced calculation line. } (14. Nfe5 Be6 { is fine for black }) 14... Nb4 15. Bxb7 Nc2 16. Re7! (16. Bxa8 Nxe1 17. Be4 Be2 18. Nd6 $14) 16... Nd7 17. Bxa8 Bf6! { a strong defensive move. Such a mess! } 18. Nxf7! Bxe7 (18... Rxf7 19. Rxf7 Kxf7 20. Rb1 $18) (18... Nxa1 19. Nh6+ Kh8 20. Re3 Nc2 21. Bd5! Nxe3 22. Bxe3 $18) 19. Nh6+ Kh8 (19... Kg7 20. Nxg4 $18) 20. Nxg4 Nxa1 21. Be4 $16 { the a1-knight is traped and white keeps a very good initiative. Definitely not an easy line to calculate till the end and mostly to evaluate correctly. }) 11... Bxf3 12. Bxf3 exd5 13. exd5 { We are now having a Benoni-like type of position. Black has a powerful g7-bishop and a majority on the queenside while white has a strong d-passed pawn and the bishop pair. Black should adopt an active play and white should try to convert in a more positional way. Maybe we can see the influence of Richard Rapport on Ding again as Rapport is a very famous Benoni player. } (13. e5 { could be tempting as well } 13... Nfd7 14. Bxd5 Nxe5 15. Bxb7 Nbc6 $36 { black gets a strong initiative but the position gets dangerous for white on light squares. }) 13... Nbd7 14. Nxc4 b5 { a logical active move, trying to take advantage of the pawn majority. } 15. Na3 Qb6 { Black's position is now objectively fine thanks to his activity. } 16. Bf4 Rfe8 { contesting the e-file. } 17. Qd2 Rad8 { the black pieces are pretty harmonious. } 18. Nc2 Nf8 { Ding aims to bring his knight to d4 via e6 but it looks a bit superficial to me. } (18... Rxe1+ 19. Rxe1 Ne8! { is a very classical way to play, bringing the knight on d6. Remember that the knight is the best blocker as a piece. } 20. b4 (20. Bg5 Bf6) (20. b3 Nd6) 20... Nd6 { black's position is healthy. }) 19. b4!? { an interesting reaction to block the black expansion and mostly to get control of the d4-square where the c2-knight could easily jump. However, that move needs to be perfectly analyzed by Gukesh as it opens the long diagonal for some tactical ideas. } (19. Rad1!? { was also logical but leads to a more complex position after } 19... Ne6! 20. Be3 { threatening b4 } 20... a5 21. a3 a4 22. Nb4! Nc7 23. d6 Bf8 24. Qc3! Rxd6 25. Bxc5 Qxc5! 26. Qxc5 Rxd1 27. Qxf8+! Kxf8 28. Rxd1 $14 { white is definitely slightly better. }) 19... c4 { the most logical continuation, creating an eternal passed pawn. Ding spent 15 minutes on this last move and is getting dangerously low of time, having only 26 minutes left. } (19... Nxd5? { has to be considered but it never works correctly. } 20. Bxd5 Bxa1 21. Rxa1 Ne6 22. Rd1 $18 { black cannot take advantage of the pin. }) (19... N6d7 20. bxc5 Qxc5 21. Rxe8 Rxe8 22. Rd1 { gives a long-term advantage for white thanks to the d-pawn. }) (19... cxb4 20. Nxb4 Ne4! { could be an interesting try as well } 21. Bxe4 Bxa1 22. Nc6! Rc8 23. Be3! Qb7 24. Bf3 $14 { white is an exchange down but all his pieces are very well placed and the compensation is pretty obvious. }) (19... Nh5 20. bxc5 Qxc5 21. Be3 Rxe3 22. Nxe3 Bxa1 23. Rxa1 $16) 20. Be3 Qa6 21. Bd4 { a normal centralizing move. } 21... Rxe1+ (21... N8d7 { is logical now that the knight cannot go to e6 anymore. } 22. Qc3 Rxe1+ 23. Rxe1 Qd6 { is pretty solid for black, white can not really improve. }) 22. Rxe1 Qxa2?! { a risky choice that was not necessary. } (22... Nxd5 { is never working } 23. Bxg7 Kxg7 24. Bxd5 $18) (22... Re8 { looked more solid } 23. a3 Rxe1+ 24. Qxe1 Qa4 $13) 23. Ra1 Qb3? { a big inaccuracy played very fast by Ding, which showed that Ding took an uncontrolled risk by taking the a2-pawn. } (23... c3! { was necessary to let the c4-square free } 24. Qxc3! (24. Rxa2 cxd2 $17) (24. Qd3 Qb3 25. Ra3 Qc4 $13) (24. Bxc3 Qc4!) (24. Qe2 Qb2) 24... Nxd5 25. Bxd5 (25. Bxg7 Nxc3) (25. Rxa2 Nxc3) (25. Qc5 Qb3) 25... Bxd4 26. Bxf7+! Qxf7 27. Nxd4 Qc4! 28. Qxc4+ bxc4 29. Nc6 Rd6 30. Nxa7 Rb6 { black should hold easily. }) 24. Ra3 Qb1+ 25. Kg2 $16 { black queen looks a bit lost there, far away from the other pieces. Ding with low time has to be careful on every move now not to get his queen traped. } 25... Rd7? { a losing move according to the engines, in an already complicated position. Ding wants to protect the a7-pawn but his pieces are now completely uncoordinated. } (25... N6d7 { was important, trying to exchange this strong d4-bishop to give some air to the black queen. } 26. Rxa7 Bxd4 27. Nxd4 Re8 28. Nxb5 Qd3!? 29. Qc1 $16 { white remains better, but black can still fight. }) 26. Ra5! { Gukesh finds the right move. The b5 pawn will fall. } 26... Qb3 (26... Ne8 { was probably the best try but white is winning after } 27. Rxb5 Bxd4 28. Nxd4 Qd3 29. Qf4 c3 30. Ra5 Rc7 (30... c2 31. Rc5) 31. Nc6 $18) 27. Ra3 { Gukesh decides to repeat the position once to get closer to the 40th move. } (27. Rxb5!) 27... Qb1 28. Ra5 Qb3 29. Rxb5! { Obviously Gukesh is not going to repeat in this position. } 29... Qd3 30. Qf4?! { not the best move according to the engines, but still a winning move. } (30. Be3! { was more precise and could simplify the position. } 30... Qxd2 (30... Nxd5 31. Rxd5 $18) 31. Bxd2 Ne8 32. Be3 $18 { the rest is just a matter of technic. }) 30... Qxc2?! (30... g5!! { Dind missed this strong dynamic defensive resource to set the g6-square free for the f8-knight. } 31. Qxg5 h6 32. Qc1 (32. Qf4 Ng6! { now we understand the sense of g5 } 33. Qc1 c3 $44) 32... c3 33. Rc5 Nxd5! 34. Bxg7 Kxg7 35. Qe1 Ng6 $44 { the position is still close to winning for white but somehow this is not so clear anymore. }) 31. Bxf6 Qf5 32. Qxf5?! { another inaccuracy. } (32. Bg5 $18 { was more precise in order not to give the g6-square. }) 32... gxf5 33. Bxg7? { Gukesh is not showing great precision in the last few moves. It was better to keep the bishop pair. The position now is not objectively winning anymore. } (33. Bg5 h6 34. Be3 Ng6 35. Rc5 c3 36. Bd1 { should be winning with a precise play. }) 33... Kxg7 34. Rc5 Ng6 { Ding finally actives this knight. } 35. Rxc4 Ne5 36. Rd4 Nc6! { a great defensive resource, maybe a move that Gukesh missed when he decided to play 32.Qxf5. } 37. Rf4?! (37. Rd2! { is the best try and black must be precise to hold } 37... Nxb4 38. d6 Rd8! (38... Kf6 39. Be2! { is winning }) 39. d7 Na6 40. Bc6 $16 { gives white big chances. }) 37... Ne7 38. b5 (38. Rd4 Kf6) 38... Kf6 { Black is activating the king and the d5-pawn will fall. The draw should not be too difficult to get for Ding now. } 39. Rd4 (39. Rh4 Kg7) 39... h6 (39... Ke5? 40. Rh4 $18) 40. Kf1 (40. d6 { is always met by } 40... Nc8) 40... Ke5?? { a huge mistake on the 40th move, after that move white position is winning again! } (40... Nc8! { was really natural in order to put the knight on a better square. } 41. Rh4 (41. Ke2 Nd6 42. Rb4 Rc7 { black can even be better ! }) 41... Kg7 42. Rc4 Nd6 43.

Nxb5 44. Rc5+ $18) 44. Ke1?! { A move I really do not like. It is not necessary but it seems that Gukesh does not want to go to the rook endgame. Nd2 is not a threat as the rook endgame is easily winning and the king is less safe on e1 than on g2 square. Black will now get some counterplay chances. } (44. h4! { is not wasting time } 44...

Both players made a lot of mistakes and imprecisions and Gukesh will probably regret his lack of precision in the important moments.  It is a miracle that Ding managed to save this game and it may be a hard psychological hit for Gukesh. We will see if this game will come back to haunt Gukesh during the next games. } 1/2-1/2
