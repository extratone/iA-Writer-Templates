1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Bf4 { as in game 6, Ding decided to bring the fight on the London System. } 3... e6 { Gukesh sticks to his plan. } (3... Bf5 { is, to me, the most fighting way to fight the London. }) 4. e3 c5 5. Be2!? { Ding decides to switch from 5.c3 in his game 6. This idea looks a bit "passive" but is actually quite clever in order to take Gukesh out of his preparation. } 5... Bd6 (5... Nc6 { is the main alternative and here we see the idea with Be2, keeping the c-pawn on the track and the c3 square for the Nb1. } 6. O-O cxd4 (6... Bd6 7. dxc5 Bxf4 (7... Bxc5 8. c4 O-O 9. Nc3 { is the game. }) 8. exf4 Qa5 9. Nbd2 Qxc5 10. Nb3 Qb6 11. c3 O-O 12. Rb1 Bd7 13. Bd3 $14 { ;½-½ Grischuk,A (2761)-So,W (2812) Paris GCT Rapid 2017 (3) and White has a very pleasant edge thanks to his control of central black squares and his better bishop. } { [%csl Gd3,Gd4,Rd7,Ge5] }) 7. exd4 Bd6 8. Bxd6 Qxd6 9. c3 O-O 10. Re1 { 1-0 Van Foreest,J (2702)-Shankland,S (2708) Tata Steel-A 84th Wijk aan Zee 2022 (13) with an easy game for White. }) (5... Qb6 6. Nc3 Bd7 7. O-O (7.

Qxb2? { is always dangerous, for instance } 9. Qd3 Qb6 10. Rab1 Qc6 11. Nb5 Na6 12. Ne5 Qc8 13. Qg3 { and White is crushing. }) 9. Rb1) 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. c4 O-O 8. O-O Nc6 9. Nc3 dxc4 10. Bxc4 $14 { Ding won the opening battle in a very tricky way. Players got a typical 5.Bf4 line from the Queen's Gambit Declined, avoiding all the Vienna, Semi-Tarrasch alternatives ! White's position is clearly more comfortable,all pieces are developped, both bishops are out of the pawn structure while the Bc8 still has some problem to enter the game so to link the rooks to the central columns. } 10... Nh5 { After a 25 minutes thought, Gukesh finds the best move according to the engine, but a dangerous one. Black wants to eliminate the strong black square bishop and a couple of pieces to freed his position, but he should be careful not to give White the initiative. } (10... Qxd1 { was played in one of Ding's second game, Richard Rapport ! } 11. Rfxd1 b6 12. Ng5! { a typical idea in this kind of structure, White reroutes their Knight to the e4 square in order to invade d6 } 12... Be7 (12... Bb7 13. Nge4 Be7 14. Nd6 $16) 13. Nge4 Rd8 14. Bb5 Bb7 15. Nd6 Bxd6 16. Bxd6 Rac8 17. f3 a6 18. Be2 b5 19. Kf2 $16 { 0-1 Rapport,R (2700)-Aronian,L (2797) Gibraltar Masters playoff 16th Caleta rapid 2018 (1.1) with a big advantage for White. }) 11. Bg5 { i didn't expect this move at all. } (11. Ne4!? { is a very important alternative } 11... Nxf4 12. Qxd8 Rxd8 13. Nxc5 b6 14. Rfd1! { everything looks Ok for Black but the position is quite tricky. } 14... bxc5 (14... Rxd1+ 15. Rxd1 bxc5 16. exf4 Bb7 17. Ne5 { leads to the same position. }) 15. Rxd8+ Nxd8 16. exf4 Bb7 17. Ne5 Nc6 18. Rd1 Nxe5 (18... Rd8 { loses a pawn after } 19. Rxd8+ Nxd8 20. Nd7 $18 { [%csl Rc5] }) 19. fxe5 { and Black will have to defend this very unpleasant ending with a worse pawn structure, though he have good drawing chances, for instance after } 19... g5 20. Rd7 Rb8) (11. Qe2!? { deserves attention, as White wants to occupy the central columns with his rooks and keep the Queen on the board. } 11... Nxf4 12. exf4 Qc7 13. g3 b6 14. Rac1 Bb7 15. Ne4 { with a very interesting position but there are no doubts that Black can fight }) 11... Be7?! { very passive, Gukesh seems very uncomfortable with the position and wants to exchange pieces at all costs. } (11... Qxd1 12. Rfxd1 h6 { is an interesting way to challenge White's 11th move. } 13. Na4!? (13. Bh4 g5 14. Bg3 (14. g4!? Nf6 15. Bg3 Nxg4 16. Bb5 { and the engine claims that White isn't worse thanks to his active play and the lack of harmony of Black pieces. }) 14... Nxg3 15. hxg3 g4) 13... Bb4 (13... hxg5 14. Nxc5 g4 15. Ng5 { with some pressure over the white squares and the possibility to reroute the Knight to d6 via e4. }) 14. a3!? Ba5 (14... hxg5? 15. axb4 g4 16. b5! gxf3 17. bxc6 bxc6 18. gxf3 { with a big advantage for White after c5-a5 }) 15. Bh4 g5 16. g4 gxh4 (16... Nf6 17. Bg3 Nxg4 18. Bd6 Re8 19. Rac1 Nf6 20. b4 Bd8 21. Bb5 { and Black is under big pressure. }) 17. gxh5 Bd8! { aiming for the h8-f6 diagonal, seems to garantee counterplay for Black. But White can still think of getting some edge due to the passive c8 }) 12. Ne4 Nf6 13. Nxf6+ { technically a novelty, but a strange one, Ding exchange too much pieces. } (13. Bxf6!? { was played in the game Melkumyan,H (2653)-Saric,A (2540) Bayern Bad Wiessee 2016, and looks more promising. } 13... Bxf6 (13... Qxd1 14. Rfxd1 gxf6 15. Bb5! { a cunning little move who underlines Black's difficulties to complete his development. But Black can hold with accurate play. } 15... f5! 16. Bxc6 bxc6 17. Nd6 Ba6 (17... Bf6?! 18. Rd2 Ba6 19. Rc1 $16) 18. Ne5 Rad8 19. Ndc4 c5 20. Na5! Bb5 21. Rxd8 Bxd8 22. a4 Be8 23. Nec4 f6! { dreaming to activate his rook via the 7th rank.White still has a tiny edge due to his better pawn structure, but Black should hold with a precise play. }) 14. Qc2 Be7 15. Rfd1 Qa5?! (15... Bd7 16. Neg5 Bxg5 17. Nxg5 Qxg5 18. Rxd7 Rac8 19. Be2 { and White can hope for an advantage with his active rook. }) 16. a3! Rd8 17. g4!? { taking squares to the a5 and seizing initiative. }) 13... Bxf6 14. Qxd8 Rxd8 15. Bxf6 gxf6 { White has a very small edge thanks to his better pawn structure. Black must be careful not to enter a bad pawn endings (remember Rubinstein !) and the Bc8 is still locked down. But on the other hand, his position is very solid and it's very easy to complete the development. I think at this point that Ding has mentally agreed to a draw. } { [%csl Yc8,Yf6,Yf7,Yh7] } 16. Rfd1 Bd7 17. Rac1 Be8 18. Rxd8 Rxd8 19. Kf1 (19. g4 { trying to fix the f6 pawn is always an idea. But after } 19... Ne5! 20. Nxe5 fxe5 { Black is totally fine, and White should be careful dealing with Black activity }) 19... Kg7 { [%cal Yf6f5,Yg7f6] } 20. a3 f5 21. Ke1 Kf6 22. Be2 { trying to organize his pieces differently, Nd2-c4 and Bf3. But Gukesh shows accuracy. } 22... Ne7! 23. g3 Rc8 24. Rxc8 Nxc8 { now the position is "dead". } 25. Nd2 Nd6 26. Nc4 Nxc4 27. Bxc4 Bc6 28. f4 b6 29. Kd2 Ke7 30. Kc3 Kd6 31. b4 f6 32. Kd4 h6 33. Bb3 Bb7 34. Bc4 Bc6 35. Bb3 Bb7 36. Bc4 Bc6 { and the draw is agreed. A very strange game, Ding took the advantage out of the opening quite easily, avoiding all the dangerous preparation of Gukesh's team and obtaining a very solid and safe plus. But after the very accurate 10...Nh5 he didn't find the best way to apply pressure over black position and the draw was quickly agreed. We are entering the "money time" of the match, every game, every move, every unaccuracy has a bigger cost as there are not many games remaining to fight back, so it can explain the rather "boring" development of the game. However, one should use every small chances available ! } 1/2-1/2
