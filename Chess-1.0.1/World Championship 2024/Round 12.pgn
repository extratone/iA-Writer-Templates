{ How will Ding react to his yesterday's catastrophe? Watching the comments, all the "experts" (yeah i know i have used quotation marks) were shouting in one voice : the match is over, Ding won't recover. In one way, it's quite true. How the World Champion can find is composure and serenity back with such a terrible mindset ? On the other hand, he has nothing else to think, he has to strike back as he already did many times in 2023. At his opposite, his challenger is experiencing a new situation. He is 18 y.o., and leading his First Championship match with 3 games to go. }
1. c4 { Ding decides to go for the English instead of his favorite London :) } 1... e6 { Gukesh changes from game 8 to a more solid Queen's Gambit structure. } (1... e5 2. Nc3 Bb4 { was the complex game 8. }) 2. g3 { played after some thoughts. } 2... d5 3. Bg2 Nf6 (3... d4 { is another way to push d5-d4, which gives more flexible options for Black to develop pieces. } 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. O-O Bc5!? { and interesting idea, freeing the e7 square for the knight } 6. d3 (6. e3 Nge7!? { is a key to have Nf5 and increase the control of the d4 square. }) 6... Nf6 7. Nbd2 { was played in the dramatic 9th game of the match between Ian Nepomniachtchi and Magnus Carlsen. }) 4. Nf3 d4 { and again we will go for a reverse-like opening ! } 5. O-O Nc6 (5... c5 { is the other way to play Benoni-like opening. I remember i witnessed a very impressive game in this position played by my country-mate, 2016 French Champion Matthieu Cornette, against... 13 years old Gukesh in the French League. } 6. e3 Nc6 7. exd4 cxd4 8. d3 Bd6 9. Bg5 h6 10. Bxf6 Qxf6 11. Nbd2 Qe7 12. a3 a5 13. Ne4 Bc7 14. c5 { introducing a very interesting idea. } 14... O-O 15. Nfd2 { going to d6 } 15... f5 16. Nd6!? { a very impressive move at the time. White sacrifices a pawn to play over the Black squares. } 16... Bxd6 17. cxd6 Qxd6 18. Nc4 Qc7 { [%csl Gc4,Rb6][%cal Rc4b6,Rc4d6,Rc4e5] } 19. Re1 Bd7 20. Rc1 Ra6 21. Re2 Re8 (21... Qb8!) 22.

Nf3 { 1-0 Gukesh,D (2533)-Cornette,M (2553) FRA-chT Top 12 Brest 2019 (3.3) and White quickly went on to win. } { [%csl Bc5,Be5] }) 6. e3 Be7 { a rare move played quickly. } (6... e5 { is the other way to play } 7. exd4 e4 { this is the idea, bringing a very complex battle after } (7... exd4 8. Re1+ Be7 9. d3 O-O 10. Na3 { is a favorable version of Benoni for White. }) 8. d5!? { is a crazy try } (8. Ng5 Nxd4 9. Nxe4 Nxe4 10. Bxe4 h5!? { The point ! Despite being a pawn down, his control of d4 and space advantage give Black a strong initiative. } 11. Nc3 c6 12. d3 Bg4 13. Re1 Be7 14. f3 Be6 15. Be3 O-O { 0-1 Daneshvar,B (2401)-Idani,P (2588) IRI-ch Tehran 2021 (10) }) 8... exf3 9. Qxf3 Ne5 10. Re1 Qe7 11. Qd1 { threatening d2-d4 } 11... Bg4!? (11... Kd8 12. h3 (12. d4 { is less accurate } 12... Bg4 13. Qd2 Nxc4! { and Rxe7 isn't with check :) }) 12... Bxh3! 13. d6! { a very clever move, playing in the same spirit than 13.Rxe5 but with a difference. } (13. Rxe5 { looks tempting } 13... Qxe5 14. Bxh3 { and it looks like White has full control for the exchange, but Black has } 14... Bc5 { and d4 isn't possible ! }) (13. Bxh3 Nf3+) 13... cxd6 { now the f8-a3 diagonal is closed so White can go for } 14. Rxe5 dxe5 15. Bxh3 Qd6 16. d4! { White has to developp pieces and open lines ! } 16... Qxd4 17. Qe2 { followed by Nc3-Be3-Rd1 and full compensations. }) 12. f3 Bxf3 13. Qa4+ Kd8 14. d4 Bxg2 (14... Nfg4 { is a possible try for Black } 15. Nc3 Qb4! 16. Qxb4 Bxb4 17. dxe5 Bc5+ 18. Kh1 Nf2+ 19. Kg1 Ng4+ (19... Nd3+!? 20. Be3 Nxe1 21. Rxe1 Bxe3+ 22. Rxe3 Bxg2 23. Kxg2 { and it seems that White has better chances with his strong center. })) 15. Rxe5 Qd7 16. Qxd7+ Nxd7 17.

Be3 Qd8 12. h3 c6 { and Black is fine compared to the game, the exchange of Knights helps to have more space and use the c-pawn to block the Bg2 }) 7... dxe3 { played very quickly } (7... O-O 8. exd4 Nxd4 9. Nc3 Nxf3+ 10. Bxf3 Rb8 { not a good idea as we will see in the game ;) } 11. Bf4 a6 { ½-½ Rapport,R (2747)-Ni,H (2674) CHN-chT China 2019 (13.3) } 12. a3 { and White is much better, his position is very comfortable. }) 8. Bxe3 e5 { well played by Gukesh he is putting a bind on d4 but in the other hand his last move weakened the d5 square. } 9. Nc3 { After 12 minutes. } 9... O-O { A tempo. White must now come up with a plan. There are 5 games left in the database. } 10. Re1 { I like very much Ding's approach. He will improve his position and threatens to play d3-d4 very early but without playing it ! It's very clever as it keeps Black under pressure and a big lack of space "the threat is stronger than his execution !" } { [%csl Be7][%cal Be1e7,Bd3d4] } 10... h6!? { a novelty played after a long thought, securing the e6 spot for the Bc8 } (10... Be6 { was already played in some games but after } 11. a3!? a5 12. Qc2 { keeping the "improving pieces and preparing d4" policy, Black position isn't comfortable at all. }) 11. a3 { play after a long thought, Ding wants to provoke } 11... a5 { to have the b5 square at his disposal. } { [%csl Yb5][%cal Bc3b5] } 12. h3 { a strong move as well, depriving Black for putting a knight or a bishop on g4. It's interesting to make a small pause here and watch the position carefully. At first sight it looks like White's position isn't promising at all. Playing d3-d4 will only helps Black to exchange pieces and to play c7-c6 to cover d5-b5 and block the Bishop on g2 so it's not easy to see any perspective. But watch it from Black's side. His Nc6 has to stay here to protect e5, Nf6 would ideally go to c5 via d7 but it takes time and you need to first move the Bc8. Rooks need to connect but first you need to move your Queen and bishop, but where to? So Black's position is quite unpleasant, which explains Gukesh's next moves. } { [%csl Yc6,Yf6,Ye7,Ya8] } 12... Be6 { Gukesh protects from d4 by protecting his Be7 from Re1 } (12... Bf5 13. d4! { is unpleasant } 13... exd4 14. Nxd4 Nxd4 15. Qxd4! c6 (15... Qxd4 16. Bxd4 { loses material as Be7 and b7 are hanging. }) 16. Qf4 { avoiding the Queen trade and using the fact that Bf5 is hanging } 16... Be6 17. Rad1 Qb8 18. Qf3 { with a slight advantage for White. } { [%csl Ge1,Gd1,Yb8,Ya8,Yf8,Yb6,Yd6] }) 13. Kh2 { same spirit, prophylaxis against Qd7. } 13... Rb8?! { Logical but weak. Gukesh anticipates the d4 push and the opening of the h1-a8 diagonal, but we can start to discerne the lack of coordination and plan for Black } 14. Qc2! { of course everybody has jumped on Ding, saying "noooo 14.Qd2 was stronger". Well i don't know, it's very logicial to remove the Queen from the d-file to put a rook on d1 and open up the center isn't it ? It also take a look to the f5-square after d3-d4... } { [%csl Ba1,Bf5][%cal Ba1d1,Bc2f5] } 14... Re8 15. Nb5 { a very strong square for the Knight, putting pressure on c7 and helping the d4 push. } { [%csl Bb5,Yc7,Yd6][%cal Bb5c7,Bb5d6,Bb5d4,Bd3d4] } 15... Bf5 { it is clear since some moves that Gukesh is playing move per move and doesn't find a general plan. } (15... Bf8 { would have a been a logical continuation of 14.. Re8 but after } 16. d4! exd4 17. Nfxd4 Nxd4 18. Nxd4 Bd7 19. Rad1 Qc8 20. Bf4 { the pressure is huge on Black's position. }) 16. Rad1 { very logical and quickly played. Now everything is ready to start concrete actions. } 16... Nd7?! { a very logical mistake ! } 17. Qd2! { A very very strong move from the World Champion. White will use the lack of harmony of Black pieces by opening up the center. } (17. c5!? { also deserves attention. }) 17... Bg6?! { too passive again, but it's hard to criticize as the main line is super complicated. } (17... Nc5 18. d4! Nd3 { was the engine main line but it's very scary ! } 19. d5 (19. Nxe5 { is also very interesting but more complicated as it is less forced than 19.d5 } 19... Nxe1 (19... Ncxe5 20. dxe5 c6 (20... Nxe1 21. Qxe1 Qc8 22. Qxa5 { White has two pawns and super active pieces for the exchange } 22... b6 23. Qc3 Rd8 24. Na7 Qe6 25. Rd5 Ra8 26. Nc6 { with absolute domination. }) 21. Nd6 Bxd6 22. exd6 Qxd6 (22... Nxe1 23. Qxe1 { With a big advantage for White }) 23. Re2 { threatening a5 but also to trap the knight by playing Qc3-Red2 ! }) 20. Qxe1 Qc8 21. Nf3! { with a total domination. Black rooks are passive, c7 and a5 are hanging, the Nc6 doesn't have much squares to go... } (21. Nxc6 bxc6 22. Na7 { looks tempting but after } 22... Qe6 23. d5 cxd5 24. Bxd5 Qa6 25. Nc6 Rbc8 26.

Bf6 { trying to delay the d4-d5 push } (20... f5 { was the best choice according to the machine, but it's a very weakening move, opening the king, closing the Bg6 and giving up the e5 and e6 squares } 21. f3!) 21. Qc2 { stepping out from the Bf6 scope. } 21... a4 22. Ne2 { Black position is hopeless, all pieces are too passive. } { [%cal Be2f4] } 22...

Nb8?! { Desperation, Gukesh is suffering since too much time and under time pressure try to give material to organize his pieces. } 26. d5! { Ding doesn't want to trap the Rc8 with Na7 and continue his plan, rolling his center pawns (he actually didn't see it !) } 26... Qd7? { Gukesh is obviously disgusted with his position. } 27. d6! c5 28. Nc7 { incredible to witness the falling of black's position. } 28... Rf8 29. Bxe4 { time to collect ! } 29... Nc6 (29...

Bd6 f6?! 39. Rxg7+! { What to say ? is it a bad game from Gukesh ? Well probably, but how does it happen ? The opening and middlegames positions were not his cup of tea. Mix of pawns dynamics and long term plan didn't allow him to use his pure calculation skills and he was totally outplayed. But what to say about the Ding performance ? Wonderful. Total domination from move 1, strong moves, deep conceptions. As in 2023, he shows that being the hunter suits him more than being hunted. Now that they are equal again, everybody hold his breath for the last two games as it's now confirmed : if Ding decides to play like a World Champion, then who can stop him ? } 1-0
